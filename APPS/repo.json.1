Open formats are preferred (png, ogg). For creating maps, we also support Tiled with the Flare plugin.\\n\\nOriginally the first game to be developed using this engine was part of this repository.

Still use at your own risk on fat32, but just don't use it on exfat please.\\n\\nIntended for use on Switches that don't have AutoRCM installed.\\n\\nThis uses a new feature added to exosphere in Atmosphere 0.8.1, so it won't work in other CFWs unless they add it in a compatible way. Also Atmosphere 0.8.1 got a silent update with a bug fix to get this feature working, so if you already downloaded it before sometime on 1st Dec you might need to update it again (if it crashes with an orange screen instead of going to RCM, you need to update). There's a commit hash in the filename, make sure you have atmosphere-0.8.1-master-bd76e73 (or if you're living in the future, Atmosphere 0.8.2 or higher will be fine too). It sounds like it currently only works if you load Atmosphere using fusee-primary.bin, not if you use hekate to load Atmosphere as separate files (using hekate to load fusee-primary.bin is ok). This will likely be fixed when hekate is updated.\\n\\nThere are two versions included in the zip, each available as an .nro (put it in its folder inside the \"switch\" folder on the root of your sd card) and as an installable .nsp (install with the stupidly-named installer of your choice).\\n- RCMRebootInstant will reboot to RCM as soon as it loads.\\n- RCMReboot will give you a 5 second countdown with a chance to change your mind.\\n\\nThe reason RCMReboot is a much bigger file than the Instant version is that I used cpasjuste's cross2d library to put stuff on screen, mostly because I've been using it for the other project I'm working on and it saved me time. Sweet library, check it out.\\n\\nCredits to cpasjuste for the aforementioned cross2d, re.lax for nro2nsp (which uses hacbrewpack by the-4n), SciresM for Atmosphere, libnx, and for fixing the bugs in them I found while making this, and everyone else who worked on Atmosphere, libnx, devkitpro and all that good stuff.\\n\\nSource included for peace of mind, and in case of licence requirement. If I've got anything horribly wrong with licensing or credits just let me know. If you want to build it yourself you'll need libnx updated with the latest commit (which isn't in a release build at the time of writing), and to figure out the cross2d setup for the non-Instant version.",

Also a lot of code has been taken from https://github.com/yourWaifu/Unofficial-Discord-3DS-Client, so thanks a lot for yourWaifu's 3ds client.\\n\\n You do need to reboot your system, otherwise the sysmodule won't start running. After rebooting you can open NXCord in homebrew menu and you will see a login screen, if you it's you first time using it.\\n\\nUsing a bot\\nSince selfbotting is not allowed, I'd recommend you to use a bot. If you don't know how to do it, just follow these simple steps. After copying the token and inviting the bot to your desired discord server, create a file named /config/nxcord/nxcord.ini and put your token there. For example your first line in the file should be token=<your token>. You need to restart your switch after modifying that file.\\n\\nSelfbotting\\nSelbotting means that you are using a third pary client to access discord with an user account. It's against the TOS of discord, thus not recommended. I've been using an user account for testing for months already and haven't been banned yet. Might be safe, but I am not responsible for any bans!\\n\\nLimitations and bugs\\nBecause this whole application is actually running in the background as a custom sysmodule, there are memory restrictions. So if you are stuck at the establishing connection screen, you will have to use a different account/bot. I'd recommend you to only join one or two not so busy servers.\\n\\nAlso right now a lot of features are missing. Head over to projects to see what possible features are planned for the future.\\n\\nMicrophone\\nThe switch itself doesn't have any external microphones, so you do need to plug in headphones/earbuds to actually utilise speaking.",

Subsequent boots are much faster.\\n\\n# Controls\\n\\nLeft analog stick = mouse pointer control\\nRight analog stick = scroll the map\\nR = left mouse click\\nL = right mouse click\\nZR = hold to slow down analog joystick mouse, useful to precisely position the pointer\\nZL = hold to speed up analog joystick mouse\\nA = right mouse click\\nB = left mouse click\\nY = shift key, hold and move mouse up/down to build above the ground\\nX = ctrl key, hold and move mouse to build multiple pieces at the same height above ground\\nDpad up = zoom out (page up key)\\nDpad down = zoom in (page down key)\\nDpad left = close topmost window (backspace key)\\nDpad right = exit construction mode (escape key)\\nR3 (press right stick in) = open cheat menu (ctrl-alt-c)\\nMinus = toggle between three touch control modes:\\nTouchpad style drag pointer with finger and tap to click, default:\\nMove a single finger to move the mouse pointer. Use short tap for left click. Hold a single finger while tapping a second finger for right click. Drag with two fingers to drag and drop.\\nJump to finger without click\\nThe pointer jumps to the finger, but the finger doesn't click. Use L/R or A/B to click\\nJump to finger with tap click\\nThe pointer jumps to the finger, and a short tap also generates a left click\\nPlus = bring up on-screen keyboard, useful for entering names, etc.\\nWhen pressing enter, it first erases existing text and replaces it with new text\\nPhysical USB keyboard and mouse are supported. Not all mice work. There's a mouse compatibility\\nchart.\\n\\nSee :\\n\\nhttps://github.com/rsn8887/openrct2/releases/latest for detailed installation instructions.\\n\\nThis is an initial appstore release and may include the full game in time.",

Although he was forced by Zhao's nanny to marry Zhao and remain on the island forever, he manages to escape with the medicine and succeeds in healing his aunt. However, he loses memory of his encounter on the island because he was tricked into consuming a memory-erasing drug earlier. When he meets Zhao again, he does not remember her but still saves her from a group of enemies, who have destroyed her home and murdered her nanny. He then decides to accompany her to southwestern China in search of her mother, who might still be alive.\\n\\nFollow the source link for more detailed instruction and controls.",

            "details": "Introduction\\nSlitherlink is a logic puzzle game created in 1989 by Japanese publisher Nikoli, famous for creating Sudoku, among many other puzzle games. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink for more info.\\n\\nI discovered the game a few years ago on the Nintendo DS with 'Puzzle Series Vol. 5: Slitherlink', which was never released outside of Japan. It's such a good game I became addicted to it, just like with Picross and Nurikabe.\\n\\nThis is my version of the game for the Nintendo Switch. It's a rewrite of one of my previous projects for the Dingoo A320. It features 456 levels in four sizes: 5x5 (easy), 7x7, 10x10, 20x20 (hard). There's also a save state function, undo button, and more.\\n\\nRules\\nIn SlitherlinkNX, you draw lines on a grid to create a meandering path, following the rules:\\n\\nThe path must form a single loop, without crossing itself or branching.\\nThe numbers indicate how many lines surround each cell. Empty cells may be surrounded by any number of lines.\\nThere is one unique solution for each level. You can draw small x's on segments that cannot be connected. You should be able to find the solution by logical deduction only, without guessing.\\n\\nFor Slitherlink beginners, I strongly recommend to consult the Wikipedia page, especially chapter 'Solution methods', which is a big help at the start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink#Solution_methods\\n\\nControls\\nd-pad: move cursor\\nX/A/B/Y: draw a line, then a cross, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nL + X/A/B/Y: draw a cross, then a line, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nR: undo previous action\\n+: open menu, allowing to: retry, save state, or quit\\n\\nCredits\\nDevelopment: Tardigrade (http://beyondds.free.fr/)\\nOriginal game: Nikoli (http://www.nikoli.com/)\\nPuzzles: Krazydad (http://www.krazydad.com/slitherlink/)\\nFont: Chopin Script\\nSounds: Junggle\\nBackground: aopsan",

It is a port of\\nthe original Triplane Turmoil game for DOS and aims to match the\\noriginal game exactly so that high scores remain comparable to the\\noriginal.\\n\\nThis is a fork of the original port of the game (http://triplane.sourceforge.net/)\\nbut updated to SDL2, so that is easier to port to other platforms.\\nIt also adds support for 4 XInput game controllers instead of only\\n2 joysticks.\\n\\nPlease read the manual page for information on how to actually play\\nthe game. Also see README.install if you want to build the game from\\nsource code.\\n\\nNintendo Switch Port\\n====================\\n\\nThe Nintendo Switch port has been built using DevkitPro (https://devkitpro.org/)\\nand libnx (https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx).\\n\\nThe whole game should be playable, controls have been adapted to the\\nSwitch, including the use of the touch screen or the left joystick\\nand the A button as a mouse to navigate the menus.\\n\\nThe roster is not functional yet, as you cannot input text, so 4\\nplayers are created by default, which have assigned the corresponding\\ngamepad to their player number.\\n\\nThe default controls are:\\n- Up/Down: left joystick or directional pad\\n- Guns: Y button\\n- Bombs: B button\\n- Roll: X button\\n- Power: R button\\n- Exit/back: - button\\n- Help: + button\\n\\nTrademarks\\n==========\\n\\nTriplane Turmoil is a trademark of Dodekaedron Software\\nCreations Oy.\\n\\nTriplane Turmoil 2 is a trademark of Draconus Entertainment Ltd.\\n\\nTriplane Classic is not a trademark.

            "details": "I present to you my own original NES emulator for the Switch, NoiES! This entire emulator was written from scratch by me. I started this project just to teach myself about how emulators are made so that I can work on larger projects in the future, but it went farther than I originally expected and is now pretty much a full-fledged emulator, apart from some minor inaccuracies and some missing mappers.\\n\\nBut there are already other NES emulators for the Switch, why use this one?\\nWell, no reason in particular. As I said before, this was more a learning experience for me, but I ported it to the Switch for the homebrew bounty and I might as well release it. I suppose the biggest advantage I can offer is that since I developed the entire emulator core myself I am very familiar with it and can easily dive in to fix bugs and add new features.\\n\\nMinor inaccuracies?\\nYes, well, I've yet to test my CPU timing for cycle accuracy so no promises there. There are also some minor timing issues with the PPU, particularly with the MMC3 IRQ counter, which can be seen in the slight vibration of the status bar in Kirby's Adventure. Another odd bug I found is that I can't seem to navigate the items menu in The Legend of Zelda. Oh, and the audio system is still kind of a work in progress, so you might notice crackles (especially in docked mode!), missing sounds, or things that sound slightly off. (Wow, doing a great job selling it here)\\n\\nMappers?\\nRight. Every ROM has a mapper; it's basically what loads different portions of the ROM memory into the CPU memory for execution. I've implemented mappers 1 through 4, which should cover a large portion of the NES library. If you have any particular games you want to play that aren't supported, tell me the mapper number (the emulator will tell you which one it is if it isn't supported) so I can place higher priority on implementing it.",

While there's a way to extricate tsec_root_key due to the way it's used, this is unfortunately not true of the package1 key\\nIf for some reason you dump TSEC keys on 6.2.0 and not fuses (secure_boot_key) you will still get everything except any of the package1 or keyblob keys (without secure_boot_key, you can't decrypt keyblobs and that's where package1 keys live)",

            "details": "\\nThis is a homebrew that enables streaming of PC games to the Nintendo Switch!\\n\\nHave you ever been told by your parents that spending hours sitting in front of a PC was bad for you (like I was)? Well, now you can play your games portably anywhere in your house!\\n\\nThis project is fairly new, so please do not consider it totally stable. If you encounter issues, feel free to submit them.\\n\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n- Stream PC screen to a Nintendo Switch in your local network\\n- 720p (full Switch-Tablet display resolution)\\n- 40-60 FPS (if not see Troubleshooting)\\n- Low delay (again, see Troubleshooting)\\n- Capture controller input on Nintendo Switch\\n- Emulate an Xbox controller on the PC\\n- PC app offers picture quality adjustments\\n\\n\\nHow to Use:\\n\\nFor the PC App, you will need to execute In-Home-Switching.exe which you can download from:\\nhttps://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/releases\\n\\nOn PC, Scp drivers must also be installed (just unzip and execute Driver Installer/ScpDriverInstaller.exe). Otherwise the program will crash silently.\\n\\nAlso please set your PC resolution to 1280x720p in Windows for getting much better performance of screen capturing while running the app.\\n\\nOn the Switch, find out its IP address (in the Internet settings) and start the app with your Switch CFW. Then type in the Switch's IP address on the PC app and hit the Connect button.\\n\\n\\nCurrent Limitations:\\n\\n- Only works with Windows 8 (64-bit) and newer\\n- No audio support atm\\n- No support for Switch CFW other than Atmosph\u00e8re or Kosmos\\n\\n\\nKnown issues:\\n\\n- So far Switch crashes when put to sleep with app running (please close app beforehand, we have not fixed this issue yet)\\n- App breaks when Switch changes from docked to handheld mode or vice-versa. Please quit the app before doing so.\\n\\n\\nFurther notices:\\n\\nThis app uses core overclocking to 1785 MHz on the Nintendo Switch. We use this measure in order to decode the incoming videos efficiently. As far as we know, there have been no reported cases of this damaging any devices. In other words, it is considered safe. Still we do not warrant for any potential device damage caused by this homebrew.\\n\\n\\nTroubleshooting:\\n\\n-- Nice videos, but sadly that delay makes it unplayable --\\n\\nIf you are experiencing delays greater than 0.1 seconds, either your PC is just too slow for your chosen quality options (try worsening image quality) or your local network is bad. Basically we need instant data transfer in your network to work properly (this has nothing to do with throughput, just latency).\\nSome WiFi-routers unfortunately just aren't up to the task.\\n\\n-- These framedrops hurt my eyes! --\\n\\nYour PC is probably too slow for encoding with the games/applications on. Try other applications, lower image quality and, if you haven't already, set your PC screen resolution to 1280x720p (saves scaling).\\n\\n-- No drops, but my framerate is just very low --\\n\\nWell, in our tests we had 60 FPS on Windows 10 with low image quality... I guess you can try the same strategies as for fixing framedrops, I hope that helps.\\n\\n\\nLicense:\\n\\nThis code is licensed GPLv3 and this has a reason: We do not want to see (or read about) any parts of this project in non-open-source software (everything that is not GPLv3 licensed). Please share the notion of free code for everyone.\\n\\n\\nCredits to:\\n\\n- ffmpeg for being such a powerful media tool that we use on PC and Switch.\\n- SwitchBrew for libNX and its ffmpeg inclusion\\n- Atmosph\u00e8re for being such a great Switch CFW\\n- Captura for showing us how to capture frame input with Windows Duplication API\\n- simontime for his switch-usb-screen-stream-sharp project for Windows\\n- ScpDriverInterface for the Xbox drivers on Windows",

For Mac users, I recommend installing the client via the Homebrew package manager. Then, connect in via:\\n\\n$ telnet [IP address] 5050\\n\\nWindows\\nThe built-in Windows telnet client does not play nicely with nxsh, so I recommend installing PuTTY. Note that connecting via a \"raw\" connection instead of a 'telnet' one will avoid a pesky 'command not found' message upon initialization of the shell. The telnet protocol sends some garbage text as it's negotiating the connection, so if you want a clean-looking shell, ditch that and go for a raw socket.",

There is a google form available here If I've missed any popular modules. Keep in mind these descriptions only show up for layeredfs based modules. It is actually possible to pull this kind of information directly out of a KIP file.\\nUpdate NSWreleases.xml\\n\\n3.0.9\\n\\nFixed incorrectly displayed Atmosphere versions.\\nCenter the detail window header.\\nAdd a size limit to the detail window header so the text doesn't bleed off the screen.\\nRedo error.cpp/h to make adding new errors easier.\\nProperly throw a error if a non 200 HTTP response is received.\\nClarify curl errors.\\nFix reboot to Atmosphere code, it should no longer need to cause a console crash.\\nFixed quite a few spelling errors.\\n\\n3.0.8\\n\\nFixed the serious crashing bug in the short lived 3.0.7 release.\\nUsing some modified code from hactool Kip Select now pulls both the official kip name and titleid from the physical kip file.\\nNSWreleases.xml has been updated to the latest version.\\n\\n3.0.6\\n\\nIn Atmospheres latest release support for rebooting directly into a payload was added. This tool now leverages this in order to (almost) seamlessly restart back into Atmosphere. In the latest Atmosphere release a file called \"/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin\" was added, this file is pretty much a direct copy of fusse_launcher.bin and is necessary for this function to work. After triggering the restart the console will crash, this is normal, press volume up to continue the restart, this seems to be a problem with Atmosphere, as there official example program dose the same thing.\\nIn all Instances where the tool works with the SD card the proper prefix sdmc:/ has been added.\\nCleared up a few error descriptions, i'm probably going to end up completely refactoring this stuff again.\\nSome preparations have been made to support cfw's other than Atmosphere. Renix support should be trivial as it's built pretty much directly off of Atmosphere, keep a eye out for a beta release in the next few days if you are interested.\\n\\n3.0.5\\n\\nLFS now displays the name of most system titles! Atmospheres integrated patches will no longer show up as numbers.\\nFixed odd bug in net code that could have caused a console crash.\\n\\n3.0.4\\n\\nYou can now download a updated NSWreleases.xml from within the tool. This file gets stored on the root of the SD card. If detected at launch the tool will use it instead of the file bundled in its romfs.\\n\\n3.0.3\\n\\nLFS now edits the correct flag, meaning enabling and disabling LFS items should now work properly.\\nThe tool now displays further information about LFS titles, such as there title name, if it can. Currently it dose this by using a bundled NSWreleases.xml, but in the future you will be able to update this file.\\nFixed a bug where if a titleid folder was named in lowercase the console would crash.\\nSome internal fixes to the makefile to make it easier for others to build the project.",

This is to help with folders that default to title ID because of unicode characters.\\nData loading has been reworked.\\nAll save data types should be supported now. The last three (System BCAT, Cache, and Temporary Storage) will only show if any data is found for them.\\nBlacklisted and unmountable titles are skipped sooner in loading, preventing JKSV from loading or creating icons for them.\\nFixed a memory leak where user icons weren't freed if titles were reloaded.\\nJKSV now has the option to backup and restore to and from ZIP archives.\\nJKSV can now write its own working directory to a ZIP archive that can be easily backed up and stored somewhere. (This is in the extra's menu).\\nNSP build is back for people who want it.\\n\\n05.20.2020\\n\\nHold time for confirmation is shortened. Options are added to completely disable it depending on what you want.\\nMinus and ZR are swapped for Options and Extras on the user selection screen\\nExploring the romfs of the title taken over by the homebrew menu is back in the extras menu.\\nSave Data can be erased from your system in the title selection screen like in the switch's settings menu. Holding A is required to confirm this.\\nA custom path for JKSV can be used by creating a file named jksv_dir.txt in your switch folder and typing the path you want to use. This must end with a /. For example, sdmc:/switch/.JKSV/ will make JKSV use a folder in the switch folder that is hidden from the hbmenu.\\nDump All can now be exited early by holding B until the current file is finished.\\nThe User selection screen has been changed to only show the maximum number of users instead of the title select's max of 32.\\nCertain strings can be translated with en-US.txt in JKSV's romfs. Naming this file trans.txt and placing it in JKSV's working directory will make JKSV load it instead of the default US text by myself. This is not 100% complete yet. Please wait if you're interested in making a translation to be included with JKSV in the future.\\nVarious new options.\\nTouch controls have been removed. Sorry.\\n\\n04.10.2020\\n\\nI wasn't planning this, but I've seen way too many people overwrite their ACNH saves with BCAT data and losing their progress.\\n\\nAdded Options Menu to User Select\\nOption one adds Device Saves to accounts when on. This is disabled by default.\\nOption two automatically creates a backup before restoring any save. These are automatically named starting with AUTO. This is enabled by default.\\nOption three is a small CPU overclock. This is to keep the text based UI mode running a bit smoother for people. This is disabled by default.\\nDeleting and Restoring saves now requires the user to hold A to 100% confirm they are sure they want to continue\\nUsers can now be changed in the title selection menu by pressing L or R.\\nTitles can now be favorited and pushed to the top of the title selection by pressing minus.\\nstdio is now used instead of C++ fstream and cuts down size about 200KB.\\nVarious changes and fixes.\\nThis is a prerelease. Parts of the UI's touch controls are not working correctly at the moment. I just don't want people accidentally losing their progress if I can help it.\\n\\n03.21.2020\\n\\nDev. Sv has been renamed Device and is moved higher up in the user select\\nJust a quick update for convenience since I'm going to be ripping apart Freebird's GUI and adapting it to JKSV as much as possible. I don't know how long this might take.\\n\\n01.06.2020\\n\\nSort of emergency release because of HID changes. Bug reports are appreciated. Changes since last year:\\n\\nEverything is enabled. You no longer need to hold a combo to enable:\\nSystem Saves\\nBCAT\\nDevice Saves\\nGeneric icons are generated for things without icons instead of using a big '?'.\\nUpdated for latest libnx\\nROMFS opening code has been removed until I have more time to remake it.\\nHopefully text mode loading is fixed\\n\\n\\n01/08/2019\\n\\nNew Icon thanks to @igniscitrinus\\nNSP Build\\nExtras menu is now accessible by pressing minus instead of button combo\\nExtra option added to delete downloaded update data and reboot console\\nTerminate Processes by titleID - For advanced users to explore normally unopenable system save data archives\\nLayout has been updated to resemble official Switch menus better\\nGraphics file updated for new libnx\\nAdded function to count directory sub dirs, files, and total size. Usable by selecting properties in Adv Mode on a directory.\\nSwitch Software Keyboard and dictionary support.\\n\\n09/15/2018\\n\\nBis storage exploration via Adv. Mode. Pressing ZL, ZR, and Y will activate this and take you to a different menu. All of the standard Adv. Mode options work here, but copying back to bis storage is disabled.\\nNAND Backup. I added this to experiment with FsStorage and stress test some things with larger files a week or two ago. I wouldn't use it as your only way to backup you NAND, but it is there.\\n\\n08/26/2018\\n\\nRewritten, more stable text-wrapping\\nEvery system font is now loaded\\nAdds title blacklisting. Pressing X in the title select will add the selected title to a list that prevents it from being shown. This is located at 'sd:/JKSV/blacklist.txt'\\nFile size is now displayed inside the progress bar\\nOther small tweaks\\n\\n08/05/2018\\n\\nShould fix games with non-ASCII titles. They will now default to their title ID.\\nTweaks some things related to strings.\\nAdds back the 3DS shortcut of holding L or R while selecting new to just auto name the backup\\nTitles are now sorted a bit better by using UTF8\\nThe input guide in the bottom right corner can now be used as button presses for touch controls. I still don't consider touch controls 100% complete\\nVarious UI tweaks and changes",

Fixes ES savefile mounting errors throughout the application (e.g. batch mode, ticket dumping).\\n\\nv1.1.9\\n\\nBuilt using libnx commit d7e6207.\\nRemoved unnecessary code in NSP dumping steps.\\nImproved GitHub JSON parsing code.\\nAdded NSP/ExeFS/RomFS support for titles with multiple Program NCAs (populated ID offset fields). Big thanks to Cirosan and ITotalJustice for testing!\\nFixed compatibility with consoles that use the new PRODINFO key generation scheme. Big thanks to dimitriblaiddyd78 from GBAtemp for reporting the issue and providing with testing!\\nFixed ExeFS/RomFS browsing/dumping support for bundled-in game updates in gamecards.\\nRecursive directory removal after a failed HFS0/ExeFS/RomFS data dump is now optional.\\nFixed RomFS section dump support for titles that hold enough files in a single directory to exceed the max file count per directory limit in FAT32 (e.g. Animal Crossing: New Horizons).\\nIn order to overcome this problem, a secondary directory is created using the current RomFS directory name + a counter value (e.g. /Model -> /Model_0).\\nThis directory is used to save the rest of the data from the current RomFS directory until:\\nAll files from the current RomFS directory have been dumped, or...\\nThe directory reaches the max file count as well and another directory must be created to continue the process (e.g. /Model_0 -> /Model_1).\\nBig thanks to Michael18751, TechGeekGamer and SusejLav for testing!\\nButton presses are now retrieved from all connected controllers.\\nHOME button presses are now only blocked during dump operations. Fixes problems with homebrew forwarders and qlaunch replacements.\\nAdditionally, long HOME button presses are now blocked as well.\\nRemoved max entry count limit for HFS0/ExeFS/RomFS browsers. All filenames are now dynamically allocated, as it should have been from the very start.\\nUpdated NACP struct to reflect latest discoveries made by 0Liam.\\nThe application now displays a FW update warning when the contents from an inserted gamecard can't be parsed because they use an unsupported NCA keygen. Thanks to ITotalJustice for spotting it!\\nThis is only a bugfix release. I don't expect to release any new versions until the rewrite is finished - the only exception being fixing some kind of feature-breaking bug. Please understand.\\n\\nv1.1.8\\n\\nAdded compatibility with latest devkitA64 and libnx releases. Thanks to HookedBehemoth for porting the extra IPC calls used by the application to the new IPC system!\\nNow using global title contexts instead of global variables for each different title property (ID, version, source storage, etc.). Simplifies metadata retrieval functions.\\nRefactored the HFS0/IStorage parsing code, optimizing all gamecard reads performed by the application.\\nIncreased dump buffer sizes to 4 MiB.\\nNCA content size is now calculated and displayed for all titles.\\nContent size for updates and DLCs is displayed in the title selector from the NSP menus.\\nAdditionally, the application now displays the size for each title in the batch dump summary screen. Plus, an approximate total dump size is calculated according to the selected titles.\\nPlease bear in mind that the displayed information does not reflect output NSP dump sizes.\\nChanges to the HFS0, ExeFS and RomFS browsers:\\nFile sizes are now displayed for all file entries.\\nDumping a file/directory won't reset the cursor position anymore.\\nDisplayed lists are now lexicographically sorted.\\nIt is now possible to perform CRC32 checksum lookups using the No-Intro database. Big thanks to the folks from No-Intro.org!\\nThis new method requires a working Internet connection at runtime.\\nFor XCI dumps, this is merely offered as an alternative to the NSWDB.COM XML database method, without replacing it. A new option has been added to the XCI dump menu, which lets the user select the verification method they wish to use.\\nFor NSP dumps, on the other hand, this offers a way to actually validate dumps:\\nThe \"CRC32 checksum calculation\" feature, which was a bit pointless, has been entirely removed. The new \"Verify dump using No-Intro database\" option has taken its place.\\nNSP dump verification is achieved by just calculating the CRC32 checksum from the output CNMT NCA and performing a lookup using the No-Intro database. This works because of the way CNMT data is handled by the application:\\nThe SHA-256 checksum for each NCA is always recalculated during the dump process, and the CNMT NCA is always patched afterwards. However, if no NCA modifications are performed, the CNMT NCA ends up being identical to its original counterpart, because the content records won't have changed at all.\\nThis lets the application verify the NSP dump by performing a CRC32 checksum lookup using the CNMT NCA data, as long as no NCA modifications take place.\\nAs such, this method only works with SD card / eMMC titles, as long as the \"Generate ticket-less dump\" option is disabled.\\nThis option doesn't appear in gamecard-related menus, and it's not compatible with batch dumps.\\nBy popular demand, an option has been added in XCI, NSP and batch dump menus to change the naming scheme used with output files to the following:\\nXCI dumps:\\nSingle game: TitleName [TitleID][TitleVersion].\\nMultigame: TitleName1 [TitleID1][TitleVersion1] + TitleName2 [TitleID2][TitleVersion2] + ... + TitleNameN [TitleIDN][TitleVersionN].\\nNSP/Batch dumps: TitleName [TitleID][TitleVersion][TitleType].\\nThe \"Remember dumped titles\" feature available in batch mode isn't affected by this new setting - batch overrides will keep using the regular naming scheme.\\nAdded an option to include delta fragment NCAs in output NSP dumps from installed SD/eMMC updates. It is disabled by default.\\nAdded a small settings menu to the ExeFS/RomFS sections with the following options:\\nSplit files bigger than 4 GiB (FAT32 support): unlike previous versions, it is now possible to control if file splitting will take place for ExeFS/RomFS file dumps, instead of always splitting them. If this option is enabled, files bigger than 4 GiB will now be split and stored in a subdirectory with the archive bit set (like NSPs).\\nSave data to CFW directory (LayeredFS): enabling this option will save output data to the directory from the CFW you're running, using the LayeredFS layout.\\nAdded a new option to the batch mode menu to control if the batch dump process should halt on any errors. If disabled, it'll make the batch dump process wait for 5 seconds on any errors, then it will keep going.\\nFree SD card space is now always displayed on every UI state. It is also displayed and updated during batch mode operations.\\nExeFS submenu is now available for updates in the orphan content list (Y button menu).\\nIt is now possible to exit the application from the batch dump summary screen.\\nA warning is now displayed in the main menu if the application is launched using applet mode. NSP dumps from base applications and updates can fail if there's not enough heap available to hold the uncompressed main NSO while generating the programinfo.xml.\\nImproved XPath query used when looking for checksum matches in the NSWDB.COM XML database. Fixes CRC32 checksum lookup for multigame cartridges.\\nEmpty RomFS directories are now properly handled by the RomFS browser.\\nRemoved a BKTR RomFS section offset check that was causing trouble while trying to perform RomFS-related operations with some updates (e.g. Luigi's Mansion 3).\\nPhysical IStorage reads are now performed to retrieve NCAs from gamecards, instead of using ncmContentStorageReadContentIdFile(). Fixes gamecard NSP/ExeFS/RomFS operations under FW versions < 4.0.0.\\nFixed unaligned IStorage reads in manual file dumps files from HFS0 partitions in gamecards. Unaligned files dumped this way should no longer contain garbage data.\\nFixed a memory leak in the XML database verification code.\\nFixed an indexing bug in the RomFS browser that could potentially cause problems when performing any action from the root directory.\\nFixed gamecard hotswapping in gamecard-related submenus.\\nFixed a free SD card space check in sequential XCI/NSP dump procedures.\\nFixed a bug where the output dump name wouldn't be generated for orphan content when no base applications are installed, preventing the NSP dump procedure from starting. Thanks to snes878 for reporting this!\\nFixed a bug that prevented to retrieve the ticket for a bundled-in gamecard update from the Secure HFS0 partition during a NSP dump procedure. Thanks to snes878 for reporting this!\\nFixed a bug where a NSP dump process would stop if no personalized ticket certificate is found in the ES system savefile (e.g. when no titles with personalized titlekey crypto have been downloaded from the eShop). Thanks to satel for reporting this!\\nFixed a bug where an empty orphan content list would have been generated if no base applications are installed. Thanks to Newb_3DS#6287 for reporting this issue!\\n\\nv1.1.7\\n\\nTickets and RSA certificates are now properly parsed from their respective system savedata files, thanks to the efforts of shchmue!\\nSpeeds up ticket / titlekey retrieval for NSP/ExeFS/RomFS operations.\\nRemoves the need to bundle RSA certificates inside the application. Yay!\\nAs a bonus, the new XS00000024 personalized ticket certificate introduced in 9.0.0 is now supported. Thanks to SimonTime for providing insight on this matter!\\nAdded NSP dump support for pre-installed titles.\\nIf the selected title uses titlekey crypto and no ticket for it can be found, a prompt will be displayed, asking the user if they want to proceed anyway (even though content decryption won't be possible).\\nThis prompt will not appear in batch dump operations. The dump procedure will always go ahead.\\nSequential NSP dump operations will only display the prompt during their first run.\\nAdded a new Ticket submenu for SD/eMMC titles. It can be used to only dump the Ticket from a specific base application / update / DLC, without having to dump its entire NSP.\\nDumped tickets are stored in sdmc:/switch/nxdumptool/Ticket.\\nA configurable option is also available to remove console specific data from dumped tickets.\\nThe encrypted + decrypted title key is displayed during the dumping process, along with the Rights ID for the title.\\nJust so you know, if you want to dump tickets from base application updates bundled in gamecards, use the HFS0 browser.\\nAdded an option in NSP/batch dump menus to control the replacement of the NPDM RSA key/sig in Program NCAs from base applications and updates:\\nUp until now, replacing both the public RSA key in the ACID section from the main.npdm file (ExeFS) and the NPDM header signature (NCA header) has been the default, non-configurable behaviour whenever Program NCA modifications were needed.\\nThis option is enabled by default - if Program NCA modifications are needed, disabling this option will make the output NSP require ACID patches to function properly under any CFW (but at the same time, it will make the Program NCA verifiable by PC tools).\\nThe rest of the possible Program NCA modifications (content distribution change and/or Rights ID removal + key area replacement) will be applied when needed, even if this option is disabled.\\nChanges related to the orphan content menu (Y button):\\nParent base application name is now retrieved for orphan updates and DLCs whenever possible, and used in menus and output NSP dumps.\\nMoved the orphan content hint from the orphan content menu to the SD/eMMC menu.\\nChanged application behaviour regarding the Lockpick_RCM keys file existence:\\nSD/eMMC menu and NSP/ExeFS/RomFS related operations are now disabled if the keys file at \"sdmc:/switch/prod.keys\" is not available.\\nAn error message telling the user to run Lockpick_RCM will be displayed in the main menu if the keys file is not available.\\nAdditionally, error messages related to data decryption will now also suggest the user to run Lockpick_RCM.\\nChanges to the generated update NSPs (thanks to The-4n and suchmememanyskill):\\nDelta Fragments are, again, always excluded from output NSP dumps, regardless of their source storage and the selected dump settings.\\nPatch Extended Data is no longer wiped from the CNMT NCA in update NSPs - only the content records are replaced accordingly.\\nFurthermore, content records from Delta Fragments are preserved as well.\\nFixed CNMT PFS0 block hash calculation when the total PFS0 size exceeds the hash block size from the PFS0 superblock in the NCA header. Removes the 0x236E02 / 2002-4535 error in Goldleaf about an invalid PFS0, triggered by update NSPs with long a CNMT PFS0 section.\\nChanges to the generated NSP XMLs:\\nRequiredDownloadSystemVersion and IdOffset elements from the CNMT XML are now properly retrieved from their true locations in the CNMT NCA.\\nAdded support for the RuntimeParameterDelivery NACP field (introduced in HOS 9.X).\\nAdded support for the IARCGeneric value in the RatingAge NACP field (introduced in HOS 9.X).\\nFixed handling of PlayLogQueryableApplicationId values.\\nBig thanks to 0Liam for documenting these changes!\\nChanges related to the application update feature:\\nAdded a forced update prompt if the application is already on the latest version.\\nThe application update option will now be disabled after a successful update.\\nRemoved the FS service reinitialize step after closing the application's RomFS at startup. This was done because romfsExit() didn't close all open file handles to the NRO when I tested it with libnx v2.2.0 some time ago, thus making the application update fail. Nonetheless, the problem has been fixed.\\nFixed UI flickering when HFS0 partition data can't be retrieved from the gamecard.\\nFurthermore, a warning about nogc spoofing is now displayed under this particular case.\\nAdded an extra NSP offset validation step for sequential NSP dumps.\\nMinor codestyle fixes.\\n\\nv1.1.6\\n\\nAdded sequential dump support: it is now possible to start a XCI/NSP dump procedure even if there's not enough space available in the SD card!\\nNo setting has to be modified in order to enable this feature - the application will automatically ask the user if they want to use this mode if there's not enough space for the full dump.\\nAt least 1 GiB (2^30 bytes) of free space must be available in order to trigger this feature.\\nA file-based checkpoint system is used to keep track of the already dumped parts (\u00e0 la Hekate).\\nThe part(s) generated in each run must be transferred to a PC before continuing the process - except for the .xci.seq/.nsp.seq files used to keep track of the current dump status.\\nNSPs generated using this method will also include a .nsp.hdr file, which holds the PFS0 header data. The information from this header is filled after writing all the NCAs, thus it is saved as an additional file. This must be used as the first file (placed before .nsp.00) when merging all the parts into a full NSP.\\nThe following options are ignored when this feature is triggered:\\nSplit output dump (FAT32 support) (XCI/NSP). File splitting will take place, regardless of the filesystem used by the SD card. Additionally, the creation of a directory with the archive bit set isn't performed with NSP dumps.\\nCreate directory with archive bit set (XCI only).\\nCRC32 checksum calculation (NSP only). CRC32 checksum calculation is still available for XCI dumps.\\nThis feature is not compatible with batch dump operations.\\nGeneral changes to batch dump operations:\\nEntries from the summary list displayed in the batch dump menu can now be manually excluded from the dump operation before starting it.\\nIt is possible to disable all entries, enable all entries and/or handpick specific titles from the summary list, thus letting the user further customize the batch dump process.\\nA new option has been added to keep track of previous successful dumps created using batch mode: \"Remember dumped titles\".\\nIf enabled, a 0-byte file will be created for each successful dump in a separate subdirectory.\\nThese files act as an override: they will make the application skip the titles they represent in later batch mode operations even if the \"Skip already dumped titles\" option is disabled.\\nThis is specially useful if someone wants to skip titles that have already been successfully dumped using batch mode - even more so if their NSPs have already been moved or deleted from the SD card.\\nTo restore the original behaviour, simply delete the contents from the \"BatchOverrides\" subdirectory inside \"NSP\".\\nFree storage space is now properly recalculated after each successful dump during a batch mode operation.\\nUI code cleanup:\\nuiDrawString(), uiGetStrWidth() and uiPrintOption() are now compatible with variable argument lists, removing the need to format a string beforehand and pass its variable to any of those functions.\\nPreprocessor definitions are now used to specify RGB colors and for calculating vertical line coordinates, greatly simplifying calls to UI functions.\\nMenu code now properly waits for any user input before drawing changes to the screen.\\nOther minor coordinate fixes.\\nThe application is now capable of automatically reading/saving dump settings from/to a configuration file.\\nThe \"Split output dump\" option is, once again, enabled by default. FAT32 is the recommended filesystem for Switch SD cards if someone wants to use homebrew applications, so it's only logical to do this.\\nFilenames for NACP icons in NSPs now properly reflect the NCA ID from its respective content file if it was modified.\\nFixed a bug that prevented to dump a specific file in the RomFS section from any update.\\nFixed a bug in the RomFS block collision check code that prevented to generate NSP dumps from certain titles with a RomFS section in Control/Manual NCAs that falls under an edge case that wasn't being handled properly. Thanks to Zet-sensei for reporting this problem!\\n\\nv1.1.5\\n\\nBuilt with latest libnx release, in order to fix HID problems under HOS 9.0.0+.\\nAdded support for Korean and Chinese character sets.\\nAdded browsing/dumping support for RomFS sections in Data NCAs from DLCs.\\nCompatible with orphan DLCs (Y button) as well.\\nOutput directories for ExeFS/RomFS operations are now properly tagged as \"(BASE)\", \"(UPD)\" or \"(DLC)\" (RomFS only), depending on the title type being processed.\\nSome measures have been taken to help speed up dumping operations:\\nCPU boost mode type 1 is now used with appletSetCpuBoostMode - only effective under HOS 7.0.0+!\\nRemoved the need for dynamic memory allocations in NCA AES-CTR block decryption/encryption steps.\\nAlthough these changes get me some extra ~4 MiB/s in most operations, keep in mind this doesn't do much to help with RomFS dumps from titles with lots of (small) file entries. Even so, although the calculated ETA can sometimes be discouraging, the dump most likely won't take that much time - just let the process advance until it hits bigger files. Sequential write speeds for the inserted SD card still play a huge role in these cases.\\nMoved base output directory from \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/\" to \"sdmc:/switch/nxdumptool/\". Both the NSWreleases.xml file and the NRO binary are also expected to be inside this directory.\\n\\nv1.1.4\\n\\nFixed building with latest libnx release.\\nOptimized RomFS recursive file dump function to not rely on code recursion as much as before, avoiding stack memory exhaustion problems. Fixes crashes while dumping RomFS data from games with lots of file entries.\\nFixed a bug that made file splitting not take place while manually dumping a file bigger than 4 GiB from the RomFS section of any title.\\nReduced max part size for split files to 0xFFFF0000 bytes in all operations (except for XCI dumps when the \"Create directory with archive bit set\" option is disabled). Fixes file access problems if the parts are used inside a directory with the archive bit set.\\nRemoved the removeDirectory() function. fsdevDeleteDirectoryRecursively() is now used instead.\\nIf a HFS0/ExeFS/RomFS data dump operation is cancelled or fails, a message telling the user to wait until the output directory is fully deleted will now be displayed.\\nImproved the cancel button detection mechanism. Regardless of the ongoing operation, holding the button for 2 seconds will now consistently cancel it.\\nProgress bar movement is now smoother.\\n\\nv1.1.3\\n\\nGeneral changes to the NSP dumping procedure:\\nCorrected and updated CNMT XML and NACP XML generation. Thanks to 0Liam!\\nAdded NACP icon retrieval for each available language.\\nAdded legalinfo.xml retrieval.\\nAdded programinfo.xml generation.\\nChanged the PFS0 file order to the following:\\nNCA content files.\\nCNMT NCA.\\nCNMT XML.\\nprograminfo.xml (if available).\\nNACP icons (if available).\\nNACP XML (if available).\\nlegalinfo.xml (if available).\\nTicket + Certificate chain (if available).\\nThese changes essentially make the NSP dumps generated by the application comparable to Scene releases that follow the AuditingTool format (like those from groups like BigBlueBox or JRP), as long as the \"Remove console specific data\" option is enabled and the \"Generate ticket-less dump\" option is disabled. Happy dumping!\\nBecause of this, dumping update NSPs from gamecards will require the keys file at \"sdmc:/switch/prod.keys\" from now on (but only if the bundled update uses titlekey crypto). Base applications and DLCs can still be dumped from gamecards without needing a keys file.\\nAdded ExeFS/RomFS browsing/dumping from game updates.\\nUpon entering ExeFS/RomFS menus, it is now possible to select which update is going to be used for ExeFS/RomFS procedures.\\nIn order to dump ExeFS/RomFS content from a installed update for a gamecard title, its respective gamecard must be inserted in the console.\\nLikewise, in order to dump ExeFS/RomFS content from a installed update for a SD/eMMC title, its respective base application must be already installed as well.\\nAdded NSP batch dump mode. Press X while on the SD/eMMC title list to configure the batch dump options and start the process. Supports skipping already dumped titles, dumping selected title types (base applications, updates, DLCs) and dumping titles from a specific source storage (SD, eMMC).\\nAdded manual directory dumping feature to the RomFS browser. Just enter the directory to be dumped and then press the Y button.\\nAdded a forced XCI dump option when either the gamecard base application count or their Title IDs can't be retrieved (useful for rare Kiosk gamecards). Press Y at the error message screen to dump the cartridge image to \"gamecard.xci\".\\nDumped content information is now displayed in the gamecard menu.\\nAdditionally, if the XCI has already been dumped, information about it will be displayed as well.\\nThe displayed information about dumped content is now updated after each new dump procedure in both gamecard and SD/eMMC menus.\\nThe NPDM ACID patching procedure is now performed with Program NCAs from bundled gamecard updates and SD/eMMC titles if the \"Generate ticket-less dump\" option is enabled.\\nFixed XCI dumping under SX OS.\\nFixed a bug in the DLC NSP dump submenu that made it impossible to change the DLC to be dumped from the selected base application if more than a single DLC is available for it. Thanks to ckurtz22!\\nFixed a bug that made the application get stuck in an endless loop after selecting the SD/eMMC dump option from the main menu if no SD/eMMC titles are available. Thanks to ckurtz22!\\nFixed a bug that made the application return an empty title list if no SD card is inserted or if it contains a \"Nintendo\" directory from another console (even if there are installed titles in the eMMC). Thanks to ckurtz22!\\n\\n\\nv1.1.2\\nDelta fragment NCAs are now included in update NSPs dumped from SD/eMMC if the \"Generate ticket-less dump\" option is disabled.\\nIt is now possible to generate ticket-less NSP dumps from bundled updates in gamecards. Please bear in mind that this option requires the external \"sdmc:/switch/prod.keys\" file.\\nUI tweaks:\\nThe application now keeps track of the selected title in SD/eMMC and \"orphan\" content modes when entering a menu and then going back to the list.\\nAfter selecting a title in the SD/eMMC menu, information about content already dumped related to the selected title will now be displayed (BASE / UPD / DLC).\\nLikewise, after selecting a title in the \"orphan\" title list (Y button), an additional line will now display if the selected title has been dumped or not.\\nThis also informs the user if the dumps contain console-specific data.\\nThree additional entries will now be displayed in the \"orphan\" title list.\\nUpwards and downwards arrows will now be displayed for lists that exceed the max element count.\\nBecause of this change, max element count for the SD/eMMC title list had to be reduced from 4 to 3.\\nLeftwards and rightwards arrowheads are now displayed in menus with options.\\nA \"hint\" message is now displayed in the \"orphan\" content mode to let the user know they'll be able to find gamecard updates in that section.\\nIf a file has been already dumped, the application will display a prompt asking the user if they want to proceed anyway or not. This doesn't apply to full HFS0/ExeFS/RomFS data dumps.\\nIt is now possible to jump from the first list element to the last one and viceversa using the D-Pad Up/Down and Left Stick Up/Down. The Right Stick is still used exclusively for fast scrolling and won't be affected by this change.\\nFixed a bug where NSP/ExeFS/RomFS dumping would fail if the written entry count returned by ncmContentMetaDatabaseListApplication() didn't match the total entry count for the selected NSP dump type.\\nFixed a bug where NSP/ExeFS/RomFS dumping would fail if an invalid title index was used with ncmContentMetaDatabaseGet().\\n\\nv1.1.1\\n\\nProject name changed to nxdumptool. This is no longer a gamecard-only tool.\\nAdded ExeFS dumping/browsing support. This feature, along with the already available RomFS options, makes the application an excellent tool for modders!\\nAdded compatibility with FS process memory layout in the key retrieval procedure while using emuMMC. Thanks to shchmue!\\nDue to public demand, NSP dumping, ExeFS dumping/browsing and RomFS dumping/browsing support has been added for base applications, updates and DLCs available in both SD card and eMMC!\\nNow it's possible to select the source storage device (gamecard, SD card / eMMC) for any operation right after launching the application.\\nThe gamecard submenu works exactly like the main menu has worked up to this point (except for the update options, which are now displayed in the new main menu).\\nThe SD card / eMMC submenu shows installed base applications along with their icons. Upon selecting a title, a submenu with NSP and RomFS options will show up. It's also possible to dump updates/DLCs for an installed base application this way.\\nIf there's installed content (updates/DLCs) with missing base application titles, pressing Y on the SD card / eMMC submenu will display this \"orphan\" content list and let you dump titles from it nonetheless.\\nIt is possible to generate console-specific NSP dumps, dumps with modified tickets to remove console-specific data, and ticket-less dumps with standard NCA key area crypto.\\nTwo new options are available in the NSP dump submenus for SD/eMMC titles: \"Remove console specific data\" and \"Generate ticket-less dump\". The latter won't appear if the former isn't enabled.\\n\"Remove console specific data\" cleans console specific data fields from a \"personalized\" ticket and replaces its RSA titlekey block with a 16-byte encrypted titlekey, essentially converting it to a \"common\" ticket. This option has no effect if the title already uses a \"common\" ticket.\\n\"Generate ticket-less dump\" goes another step ahead by cleaning up the Rights ID field in every NCA content file that includes it, stores the decrypted titlekey in the NCA key area and then encrypts this area using standard crypto, removing the need for a tik/cert combination.\\nConsole-specific NSP dumps and dumps with modified tickets include both tik and cert files.\\nAll NSP dumps generated from installed SD/eMMC titles include both .cnmt.xml and .nacp.xml files whenever possible.\\nSadly, due to limitations in the methods currently used to perform key retrieval/derivation at runtime, NSP dumping, ExeFS dumping/browsing and RomFS dumping/browsing for SD/eMMC titles require the \"sdmc:/switch/prod.keys\" file. Specifically, these are the needed keys:\\neticket_rsa_kek.\\ntitlekek_## (varies from 00 to 1F).\\nAdditionally, ticket-less NSP dumps for SD/eMMC titles also require the following keys:\\nkey_area_key_application_## (varies from 00 to 1F).\\nkey_area_key_ocean_## (varies from 00 to 1F).\\nkey_area_key_system_## (varies from 00 to 1F).\\nAll gamecard-related operations can still be performed without the need for a keys file!\\nOutput data generated by the application will now be saved to its corresponding subdirectory in \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/\":\\nXCI dumps: \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/XCI/\".\\nNSP dumps: \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/NSP/\".\\nHFS0 data: \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/HFS0/\".\\nExeFS data: \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/ExeFS/\".\\nRomFS data: \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/RomFS/\".\\nCertificate dumps: \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/Certificate/\".\\nThe location for the NSWDB.COM XML database has been moved to \"sdmc:/nxdumptool/NSWreleases.xml\".\\nTickets from updates with titlekey crypto dumped from gamecards are now converted to regular \"common\" tickets before being written to the output NSP dump.\\nThe content distribution type for updates dumped from custom XCIs mounted through SX OS is now set to \"download\".\\nFixed a NCM service handle exhaustion bug if an error ocurred while reading the RomFS section entry from the Program NCA for any base application.\\nChanged the application icon yet again. Big thanks to RattletraPM!\\nMinor changes and other various general fixes.\\n\\nv1.1.0\\n\\nReplaced the application icon with a new, stylish one made by RattletraPM. Thanks a lot!\\nGamecard base application icons are now retrieved and displayed in the menu.\\nL/ZL/R/ZR buttons can now be used to change the displayed base application info if a multigame cart is inserted, instead of displaying everything right away.\\nThe Nintendo Extension shared font is now used to display bitmaps representing controller buttons and sticks instead of just using text to reference them.\\nReplaced the mbedtls-based AES and SHA-256 implementations with functions from the hardware accelerated cryptography API from libnx.\\nAdded an option to generate split XCI dumps using a directory with the archive bit set, just like split NSP dumps. It will only appear if \"Split output dump\" is enabled.\\nFixed ETA calculation.\\nEnabled ETA calculation in full HFS0 partition data dumps.\\nFixed CRC32 checksum calculation for gamecard certificate dumps.\\nAdded Program NCA RomFS section parser:\\nSupports filesystem dumping, filesystem browsing, manual file dumping and file splitting. Enjoy datamining your gamecards!\\nCompatible with multigame carts. You'll be able to choose which base application RomFS will be dumped/browsed from a submenu.\\nOutput files will be saved to: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) (RomFS)/\".\\nAdded high contrast directory/file icons from GNOME project to file browsing modes (HFS0 / RomFS).\\nFixed the NSP generation code (based on 4NXCI / hacPack):\\nDelta Fragment NCAs are now discarded.\\nThe SHA-256 checksum is recalculated for every NCA content after being modified, resulting in new NCA IDs.\\nThe ACID public key is replaced in the NPDM section from the Program NCA. All the related NCA/PFS0 Superblock SHA-256 hashes are recalculated.\\nThe NPDM signature in the Program NCA header is now replaced as well.\\nThe content records from the Application CNMT are updated with proper SHA-256 hashes and new NCA IDs. All the related NCA/PFS0 Superblock hashes are recalculated.\\nNACP XMLs are now generated as well.\\nBecause of all these changes, the CRC32 checksum can't be calculated until the dump procedure is complete.\\nIf this option is enabled, the application will take extra time after the NSP dump has been completed to calculate the CRC32 checksum. Nonetheless, you'll be able to cancel this procedure.\\nA warning message will appear in the NSP dump menu if CRC32 checksum calculation is enabled to inform the user about this extra step.\\nFurthermore, the output CRC32 checksum will be different on each new dump. This is because the NPDM signature in the Program NCA header uses a random seed.\\nThis effectively makes the generated NSPs only need ES patches to work. ACID patches shouldn't be needed anymore.\\nAdded NSP dumping support for Patch and AddOnContent title types with gamecards that include bundled Updates/DLCs:\\nThe information displayed in the main menu now shows how many Updates/DLCs are bundled in the inserted gamecard (per application and in total).\\nIf a bundled gamecard update features a populated Rights ID bitfield, both its Ticket and Certificate will get added to the output NSP.\\nAdditionally, the NSP dump menu has been divided in three subcategories: base application, update and DLC.\\nEach submenu will only appear if the inserted gamecard holds at least one title belonging to the category it represents.\\nIf only the base application is included, like most gamecards, choosing the NSP dump option in the main menu will take you right to the base application dump menu.\\nOnce you enter a submenu, you'll be able to choose exactly which title to dump belonging to that category.\\nOutput update NSPs will not be modified in any way. Thus, unlike NSPs from base applications and DLCs, their CRC32 checksums will always be the same.\\nFixed the minimum system version field size in the extended CNMT header struct. Thanks to @0Liam !\\nChanged the naming convention for output NSP dumps:\\nBase application: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) (BASE).nsp\".\\nUpdate: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[UpdateVersion] ([UpdateTitleID]) (UPD).nsp\".\\nIf a matching base application isn't found: \"sdmc:/[UpdateTitleID] v[UpdateVersion] (UPD).nsp\".\\nDLC: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[DLCVersion] ([DLCTitleID]) (DLC).nsp\".\\nIf a matching base application isn't found: \"sdmc:/[DLCTitleID] v[DLCVersion] (DLC).nsp\".\\nThe application is now able to retrieve the NCA header key and perform NCA key area decryption at runtime, using the SPL services. Thus, is isn't needed to run Lockpick beforehand anymore to dump NSPs (nor to dump/browse RomFS data).\\nIf the inserted gamecard includes a bundled update, its version number will now be used in the output filename for XCI, HFS0 and gamecard certificate dumps.\\nMinor improvements to the file splitting code.\\nAdditionally, the filename for the current part will now be displayed and updated for all operations if file splitting is enabled.\\nThe application update feature will now use the launch path from argv if it's available. Otherwise, it defaults to \"sdmc:/switch/gcdumptool.nro\".\\nCosmetic fixes to the UI layout.\\nNCM service resources are now properly closed.\\nRemoved unnecessary service (de)initializations.\\n\\nv1.0.8\\n\\nAdded proper metadata reading from multigame carts.\\nAdded gamecard -> NSP dump option:\\nCompatible with file splitting (for FAT32 support). The same layout from splitNSP.py is used: a directory with numbered part files (00, 01, etc.). The archive bit is enabled right away in this directory to allow HOS to treat it as if it were a whole file. This way, it can be used with any application with NSP-handling capabilities.\\nCompatible with CRC32 checksum calculation. Disclaimer: NSP dumps can't be verified against the XML database.\\nOutput NSPs contain a metadata XML file based on the information from the CNMT NCA for the application, which is decrypted using code from hactool. The necessary keyset is loaded from \"sdmc:/switch/prod.keys\", which can be generated using Lockpick.\\nIf a multigame cart is used, you'll be able to choose which application to dump from the menu.\\nDump verification process tweaked for multigame carts: it'll now look for a possible checksum match using the Title IDs from all bundled applications.\\nImproved error reporting in dumper.c when a write operation fails. Furthermore, if a write error is produced when trying to write data to an offset past the FAT32 file size limit (0xFFFFFFFF bytes), the application will suggest the user to enable the file splitting option.\\nTweaked part sizes for splitted dumps: XCI/raw partition/manual file dump part size now matches the one used by XCI-Cutter, while the NSP part size matches the one used by splitNSP.py.\\nMinor fixes to the UI code.\\n\\nv1.0.7\\n\\nFixed a segmentation fault when trying to free an invalid XML node data pointer when a Scene release from NSWReleases.xml with a matching Title ID misses data related to that node.\\nAdded a message suggesting the user to restart the application after a successful update.\\n\\nv1.0.6\\n\\nUpdated application codebase in order to make it compatible with the latest devkitA64 and libnx releases.\\nRemoved some fs-srv service functions from fsext.c/h that have been included in libnx (and fixed the ones that haven't).\\nRevamped the GFX code to replace the 8x8 ASCII font with the shared system font, using the pl service and FreeType.\\nEnabled (and fixed) the in-app update option. HTTPS compatibility is achieved through the mbedtls portlib.\\nDisabled screen dimming and auto sleep.\\nAdded file counter to partition browser.\\nChanged the naming convention for split gamecard dumps to *.xc[part number], in order to make them compatible with SX OS and other tools right away.\\nIncreased the delay after inserting a new gamecard by 1 second.\\nAdded a gamecard detection thread to monitor gamecard state changes in a better way. This thread is hooked to a gamecard detection kernel handle retrieved through an IEventNotifier object.\\nReplaced partition filesystem mounting through fs-srv service calls with manual HFS0 partition header parsing. This should fix issues when browsing the Logo partition from type 0x02 gamecards.\\nBlocked HOME button presses when running as a regular/system application instead of an applet. A warning message will be displayed whenever any operation is started if the application is running as an applet.\\nAdded detection for bundled FW versions 6.0.0 - 8.0\\n\\nv1.0.5:\\n\\nFixed game card version reading (now using the ncm service instead of retrieving it from the cached Control.nacp).\\nAdded ability to read and identify FW update versions bundled with game cards.\\nIn case an error occurs while reading the game card Title ID, the application will also display the FW version update bundled with it along with an explanation.\\nRemoved output XCI dump renaming based on the XML database from nswdb.com.\\nOutput naming scheme changed. Characters out of the ASCII range are replaced with underscores:\\nXCI dump: 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]).xci'.\\nRaw partition dump: 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) - Partition [PartitionIndex] ([PartitionName]).hfs0'.\\nPartition data dump (directory): 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) - Partition [PartitionIndex] ([PartitionName])/'.\\nCertificate dump: 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) - Certificate ([CRC32]).bin'.\\nManual file dumps will now be saved to their corresponding directory instead of the SD card root.\\nAdded a XML database update option in the main menu.\\nAdded an update application option in the main menu. It isn't working at this moment because libcurl has problems dealing with secure connections, and as such the option has been disabled (pressing A on it does nothing). Nonetheless, the code to parse JSON responses from the GitHub API is pretty much ready, so it's just a matter of time.",

Others will run much faster than they did before. Be warned that maximum overclock will probably heat up your Switch more than normal and extensive use might negatively affect your system.\\n\\nv0.4\\n\\n-Added screen rotation and screen layout settings; functionality is identical to desktop melonDS\\n-The emulation window is now drawn with OpenGL\\n-Having Vsync on is now just as fast as having it off\\n-Vsync option has been removed\\n\\nNOTE: Don't get too excited by the OpenGL! I'm only using it to draw the software renderer's output to the screen. There is NO speed boost from this right now. Yes, there is a bit of a speed boost in this build, but it has little to do with OpenGL.\\n\\nv0.3.1\\nFix sound output\\n\\nv0.3\\n\\nmelonDS was just bumped to version 0.7 a few hours ago, so here's another release from me as well! This release comes with an options menu containing four whole options (crazy, I know). I've also reworked some things to prevent flickering when navigating the menus.\\n\\nThe options added include:\\nBoot game directly - Disabling this will allow you to boot into the DS firmware instead of automatically running a game.\\nThreaded 3D renderer - Speeds up 3D rendering; you probably don't want to turn this off.\\nVsync - While not technically being Vsync, the functionality is similar enough. Disabling this will let the screen render without waiting for a frame to finish. It'll give you a performance increase at the cost of screen tearing and minor artifacts.\\nAudio output - Self-explanatory. Disable to sacrifice audio for a small performance boost.\\n\\nThe first two options are actual melonDS options, while the last two are custom ones I added for the purpose of increasing performance. You still probably won't get full speed, and the trade-offs may or may not be worth it, but at least it's something.\\n\\nv0.2\\n\\nThis release features the latest commits from upstream melonDS, which mainly feature the addition of experimental savestates. To use savestates on the Switch port, press L to save and R to load. You only get one slot per game. This is only temporary until I make some sort of actual menu system. Note that the DS L and R buttons are mapped to the Switch ZL and ZR buttons; don't get them mixed up!",

Files required:\\n\\nbios7.bin, 16KB: ARM7 BIOS\\nbios9.bin, 4KB: ARM9 BIOS\\nfirmware.bin, 128/256/512KB: firmware\\nFirmware boot requires a firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite. DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games directly.\\n\\nPossible firmware sizes\\n128KB: DSi/3DS DS-mode firmware (reduced size due to lacking bootcode)\\n256KB: regular DS firmware\\n512KB: iQue DS firmware\\nDS BIOS dumps from a 3DS can be used with no compatibility issues. DSi BIOS dumps should be usable too, provided they were dumped properly.\\n\\nAs for the rest, the interface should be pretty straightforward. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask, though!",

While 720p should be mostly fine, 1080p support can vary with medias and bit rates. If so (audio de-sync for example), increasing buffering can help in most situation. This can be done in the main menu (left). Please note that increasing the buffer size will have some side effect like longer loading and seeking time, but also to stop a video (buffers needs to be released). This is more visible when using http streams, of course.\\n\\npPlay can stream media from an http server with directory listing enabled. To do so, you must edit the pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg) to add your server address (NETWORK = 'http://samples.ffmpeg.org/';). Please note that you need a good and stable network connection for this, and you will probably have to set buffering to \"VeryHigh\" for smoother experience.\\n\\npPlay will extract media information in background, but i did spot a very few files which make the device crash. If so, you can disable this in pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg): CACHE_MEDIA_INFO = 0;\\n\\npPlay will push the cpu speed when a 1080p media is played, and restore previous speed when paused or stopped. This is safe but can be disabled in the main option menu (left).\\n\\nPlease note that there is a (big?) delay when switching video/audio/subtitles streams to see the change. This is worked on but in the meantime, be patient :)",

It now stores an entire cheat database inside and still manages to be ~1MB lighter than the previous stable release.\\nFixed: Checkpoint doesn't run anymore if nx-hbmenu is launched over a system applet (like Album).\\nRefactoring, refactoring, refactoring...\\nCheat management\\nFrom this release, Checkpoint also handles cheat management. Source cheat files are provided by Sharkive which is another project that have been going on from a while now.\\n\\nOriginally, Sharkive was a 3DS homebrew capable of managing cheats. Since its functionalities have been now integrated into Checkpoint, the app itself has been deprecated and discontinued. If you try to run Sharkive, it'll just close itself now.\\n\\nTo learn more about cheat codes, how to submit them and how to get involved into the project, Sharkive's repo is a good place to start.\\n\\nUser ikeb0mb#2998 made a really useful video tutorial to show you how to use the Cheat Engine. Please have a look!\\n\\nv3.6\\n\\nAdded: a bridge functionality between Checkpoint for Switch and PKSM (for 3DS, v6.0.0 and above) has been implemented.\\nIt allows to send (and then receive back) a save file over the network, to allow manipulations without having to browse your save backups manually on your PC.\\nIt also needs to be manually enabled by editing your configuration file. Once it's enabled, you can access the bridge by pressing L+R on a valid game.\\nThis feature currently works only with LGPE.\\nFixed: buttons are now responsive as before while navigating the UI.\\nFixed: titles with black background are now displayed properly.\\nFixed: checkmark color doesn't confuse with title icons anymore.\\nFixed: text doesn't bleed textboxes like before anymore.\\n\\nv3.5\\n\\nAdded support for Hardware Acceleration. Checkpoint now relies on the GPU to render graphics and text, removing load from the CPU.\\nThe interface now relies on SDL2 to render images and text.\\nText rendering is optimized by using a customized version of SDL_FontCache which caches glyphs in memory rather than creating textures every frame. This also allows to use the system font already available in the console.\\nCheckpoint caches from PlSharedFontType_Standard and PlSharedFontType_NintendoExt fonts, so both regular characters and symbols are now supported to be rendered on screen.\\nAdded option to set a title as Favorite. You can now edit your configuration file to set a title id to be a favorite title, so this will always appear at the top of the title list.\\nFixed crashes caused by too many file descriptors opened.\\nKey behaviour changed. ( thanks @IBNobody )\\nYou can now select rows in the backup list, creating backups and restoring a backup just with the button A.\\nPressing Y will select the current title but deactivate/reset the backup list. It will also enable the backup touch button only. Creating a backup will then disable the backup touch button. This makes it more clear to the user what buttons / UI elements are relevant to multi-backup.\\nFixed occasional crashes while changing account.\\nCheckpoint now uses latest libnx 1.5.0, which supports timezone and fixes wrong default backup names if your console never connected to internet.\\nCheckpoint is now compiled using C++17.",

            "details": "Why use Checkpoint?\\n\\nCheckpoint is created following ideas of simplicity and efficiency. The UI has been designed to condense as many options as possible, while keeping it simple to work with.\\n\\nMoreover, Checkpoint is extremely lightweight - while being packaged with a nice graphic user interface - and is built using the most recent libraries available.\\n\\nCheckpoint for Switch natively supports NAND saves for the titles you have played. Title information are loaded automatically.\\n\\nWorking path\\n\\nCheckpoint relies on the following folders to store the files it generates. Note that all the working directories are automatically generated on first launch (or when Checkpoint finds a new title that doesn't have a working directory yet).\\n\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint: root path\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/config.json: custom configuration file\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/saves/<title id> <game title>: root path for all the save backups for a generic game\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nCheckpoint for Switch only runs on homebrew launcher. Make sure you're running up-to-date payloads.\\n\\nThe first launch will take considerably longer than usual (usually 1-2 minutes depending on how many titles you have installed), due to the working directories being created - Checkpoint will be significatively faster upon launch from then on.\\n\\nYou can scroll between the title list with the DPAD/LR and target a title with A when the selector is on it. Now, you can use the DPAD or the touchscreen to select a target backup to restore/overwrite.",

This is not a bandwidth problem and even streaming just audio will be slightly delayed.\\nStreaming both audio and video is possible only via RTSP as stdin mode only supports one channel. Read the advanced section of the guide to find out how to launch mpv in low-latency mode.\\nUSB streaming protocol has been updated to improve performances.\\nOn windows the driver has been changed to WinUsb, if you previously installed the libusb driver you will have to replace it with zadig. The guide has been updated to explain how.\\nIf you wish to keep on streaming with libusb add --no-winusb to the command line or enable Force LibUsb backend in the GUI.\\nOn linux libusb is still used and nothing changes.\\nTCPBridge protocol has been changed as well to improve performances.\\nReduced the memory usage of SysDVR from 3MB to ~1.1MB if you previously used the USB-only build due to memory concerns check if this solves your problems.\\nThis may also fix SXOS compatibility but i haven't tested, will update once someone lets me know.\\nEdit: from early user reports SXOS seems to work fine, please comment in issue #39 if you still experience crashes.\\nAll legacy args for SysDVR-Client have been replaced with a new syntax, less used functions have been removed, if you're using bat files from the GUI delete them and create new ones.\\nDue to the protocol changes you can't use previous versions of the client and clientGUI with the new sysmodule\\nNow it's possible to stream to stdout so you can pipe the raw data to any video player (one channel only)\\nFix #30 #33 and several other bugs and crashes.\\n\\n3.0\\n\\nUsbStream has been renamed to SysDVR-Client, if you have the old version on your pc, delete it before extracting the new zip.\\nRTSP Streaming has been implemented in both SysDVR and SysDVR-Client, this implies the following:\\nAudio and video are finally properly synchronized.\\nRandom stream desyncronization (lag) should be finally solved, it can still happen depending on the player and connection stability but pausing and unpausing the stream is enough to fix it.\\nNative support for many more players and other software such as OBS, live streaming from SysDVR has never been easier.\\nAs now streaming requires a single player instance the GoLive feature on discord works as expected.\\nUnfortunately due to RTSP caching latency may have slightly increased, some players allow to disable it but not all, in the end is a stability/syncronization vs delay compromise (if you prefer less delay most of the previous modes are still available but not recommended)\\nWhile RTSP works fine mostly, some players like vlc don't really play nice with it, mpv is still the recommended player\\nThe following streaming modes have been added:\\nDirect RTSP from SysDVR: it's possible to connect a player to the switch in the local network without any extra setup. This means you don't even need SysDVR-client, just type your switch ip address in mpv on your phone/pc and you're good to go !\\nTCP Bridge: video and audio data is sent via network to UsbStream and it's relayed over RTSP (this has a few advantages over Direct RTSP as explained in the guide)\\nRTSP mode in UsbStream: video and audio data are sent over USB and streamed via RTSP on the local pc\\nThe old TCP streaming mode has been removed in favor of TCP bridge, it had major syncronization issues, in case you still need it it's still available in older versions.\\nFixed a few issues reported on GitHub\\nSince there have been some major changes the guide in the readme has been rewritten, please be sure to read it again to use the new modes\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nThis update addresses most of the issues reported since the first release, in particular:\\n\\nThe Network and USB versions have been merged in a single sysmodule, the zip includes an homebrew to set the streaming mode without having to reboot.\\nThis also allows to temporarily disable the USB stream so you can launch other homebrews like nxmtp or GoldLeaf (solves #5)\\nAs low memory usage is important to some users an USB-Only version is still provided, this however does not support the settings app and you have to manually remove it and reboot to use an homebrew requiring USB access.\\nFixed the annoying \"10 minutes bug\" #2\\nAdded UsbStreamGUI (Windows only), a graphical launcher for UsbStream for less experienced users\\nMinor changes to UsbStream to help troubleshoot issues\\nThe guide in readme has been updated to include latest chages, be sure to check it out.",

            "details": "This is an experimental sysmodule that allows capturing the running game output to a pc via USB or network connection.\\nTwo versions are provided:\\n\\nSysDVR.zip is the \"full\" version, can stream using both modes and comes with an homebrew app to switch between them\\nSysDVR-USB-Only.zip(not included in this download) will only stream via USB but uses less memory and should run alongside multiple sysmodules.\\nYou should use the full version unless you have specific requirements.\\n\\nTo play the stream mpv player is recommended as it's the most straight forward to set up, any other player that supports raw h264 streams via tcp or stdin should work but you may have to configure it manually.\\n\\nLimitations\\nVideo quality is fixed to 720p @ 30fps with h264 compression (hardware limit)\\nAudio quality is fixed to 16bit PCM @ 48kHz stereo. Not compressed\\nOnly works on games that have video recording enabled (aka you can long-press the capture button to save a video)\\nVideo and audio are two different streams, they're likely to desync as they require two different player instances. Vlc does support a secondary audio stream but i didn't manage to get it working properly.\\nOnly captures game output. System UI, home menu and homebrews running as applet won't be captured\\nVideo feed is not realtime, there will always be a minimum of ~1 second of delay.\\nStream quality depends heavily on the environment, bad usb wires or low wifi signal can affect it significantly.\\nUSB streaming is not available when docked\\nRequires firmware >= 6.0.0\\nClearly with these limitations this sysmodule doesn't allow \"remote play\" and does not replace a capture card.\\n\\nUsage\\nSetting up the sysmodule\\nThe provided builds already contain the correct file structure, you should just be able to extract them to your sd card.\\nCFWs other than atmosphere should work but I won't provide support for them.\\n\\nBy default SysDVR will stream over network, to switch between modes and set the default one you can use the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.\\n\\nNetwork streaming\\nThis is the easiest way to stream, In this mode the sysmodule is completely standalone, you should be able to play the video stream just by running mpv tcp://<switch ip address>:6666 --no-correct-pts --fps=30 and mpv tcp://<switch ip addr>:6667 --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000 for audio.\\nWhen using network streaming it's not recommended to stream both audio and video at the same time as it may cause slowdowns. In general network streaming has more lag and delay compared to USB, it is worth the time to set it up, especially for gameplay recording.\\n\\nUSB streaming\\nTo stream via usb you need the UsbStream program, it's built using .NET core and is compatible with linux as well.\\nFirst of all you should make sure to install .NET core 3 on your pc, then proceed to setup the drivers, this step is needed only the first time:\\n\\nDriver setup on windows\\nOn windows you may get the device not found or platform not supported errors or very bad performance on the stream, in this case you may have the wrong driver set up.\\nPlug your switch in the computer while running SysDVR in USB mode and launch zadig install the libusb-win32 driver for the \"Nintendo Switch\" device. Before installing make sure the target device USB ID is 057e 3006, if it's different the sysmodule may not be running, try waiting a bit (it should start around 20 seconds after the console boot) or check again your setup.\\nThis won't interfere with other applications that communicate with the switch via usb as this sysmodule uses a different product id.\\n\\nDriver setup on linux\\nOn linux you may have errors about loading the libusb-1.0 library, this happens when the file name is different than the one expected by dotnet, you can make a symlink as described on the LibUsbDotNet repo:\\nsudo find / -name \"libusb-1.0*.so*\" and then\\n\\ncd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\\nsudo ln -s libusb-1.0.so.0 libusb-1.0.so\\n(Example commands, change the paths with the one you find on your pc)\\n\\nStreaming\\nMost Windows users can simply use UsbStreamGUI, it will allow you to select the streaming mode and launch UsbStream directly.\\n\\nLinux users will have to use the UsbStream command line interface (Note that this is available on windows too and provides a few more options compared to UsbStreamGUI)\\nLaunch UsbStream like this: UsbStream video <streaming mode> <arg> audio <streaming mode> <arg>\\nThese are valid streaming modes:\\n\\nstdin : pipes the received data directly to a video player via stdin, this will use no caching so you'll have low delay but it may lag. This will likely require you to provide the args to pass to the player, you can do so like this: video stdin <player executable> args \"<args list>\"\\nmpv : same as stdin but will automatically set up the args for mpv so it just requires the path\\ntcp : opens a tcp server so players can connect to it and use their own caching mechanism to remove or reduce lag (at the price of an higher delay)\\nfile : writes the received data directly to a file so it can be converted to a common format later.\\nWhen using mpv the arg is the path of mpv on your pc (use the .com file on windows), you have to repeat it twice if using both streams.\\nThe tcp option requires a free port number and the file option the output file path.\\nTo disable a stream just omit the name and its fields.\\n\\nExample commands:\\n\\nUsbStream audio mpv C:/programs/mpv/mpv : Plays audio via mpv located at C:/programs/mpv/mpv, video is ignored\\nUsbStream video mpv ./mpv audio mpv ./mpv : Plays video and audio via mpv (path has to be specified twice)\\nUsbStream video tcp 1337 audio file C:/audio.raw : Streams video over port 1337 while saving audio to disk\\nLaunching UsbStream without any parameter will display more options and examples.\\nTo connect to the tcp streams you can use: mpv tcp://localhost:<video port> --no-correct-pts --fps=30 for video and mpv tcp://localhost:<audio port> --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000 for audio\\n\\nTips\\nTo get the most out of this sysmodule you will have to do some testing to find configuration that works best for you, here are some tips and useful information:\\n\\nIf the video stream doesn't start immediately try moving the camera around in the game, to display something the video player needs to acquire a video keyframe first.\\nAn usb 3 wire is slightly better than usb 2, but both should work.\\nQuality also depends on the cpu utilization of the game you're running, OC can improve performances.\\nUsing cache will reduce lags at the cost of an higher delay, for mpv it's on by default (except when using usb stream with mpv mode), if you want to try without it the command line arg for mpv is --cache=no --cache-secs=0. There's a lot of room for experimenting here, try different values to find the combination that works best for you.\\nIf using no caching when the screen goes full black or white (eg loading screens) it may cause some desync and the stream will start to drop frames, eventually it will fix by itself but it could take some time, the fastest solution is to open the home menu for a few seconds and then resume the game, for usb stream you can try setting the --desync-fix flag (this will introduce glitches).\\nCommon issues\\nAfter copying the sysmodule to the sd atmosphere won't boot anymore\\nThis happens if you have too many sysmodules or ones particulary heavy like sysftpd, remove them to launch SysDVR.\\nIf you really need other sysmodules at the same time you can try using the USB-Only version as it uses less memory (512K vs 3MB)\\nTo remove SysDVR delete the /atmosphere/titles/00FF0000A53BB665 folder, to remove other sysmodules if you're not sure about the right ID delete the whole /atmosphere folder and download a fresh copy of atmosphere.\\n\\nHomebrews using USB like GoldLeaf or nxmtp won't launch anymore\\nThis is because the USB interface is being used by SysDVR, if you're using the full version you can swith streaming modes using the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.\\n\\nWhen using network stream there's a lot of delay or it increses over time\\nMpv will use a cache buffer to avoid lag when the connection drops some packets but this increases delay, you can disable it by using --cache=no --cache-secs=0\\n\\nThe video is laggy or there are a lot of glitches\\nMake sure the connection between the console and your pc is good enough, if streaming via network move both closer to the router or switch to LAN, for USB try using an higher quality wire.",

Still use at your own risk on fat32, but just don't use it on exfat please.\\n\\nIntended for use on Switches that don't have AutoRCM installed.\\n\\nThis uses a new feature added to exosphere in Atmosphere 0.8.1, so it won't work in other CFWs unless they add it in a compatible way. Also Atmosphere 0.8.1 got a silent update with a bug fix to get this feature working, so if you already downloaded it before sometime on 1st Dec you might need to update it again (if it crashes with an orange screen instead of going to RCM, you need to update). There's a commit hash in the filename, make sure you have atmosphere-0.8.1-master-bd76e73 (or if you're living in the future, Atmosphere 0.8.2 or higher will be fine too). It sounds like it currently only works if you load Atmosphere using fusee-primary.bin, not if you use hekate to load Atmosphere as separate files (using hekate to load fusee-primary.bin is ok). This will likely be fixed when hekate is updated.\\n\\nThere are two versions included in the zip, each available as an .nro (put it in its folder inside the \"switch\" folder on the root of your sd card) and as an installable .nsp (install with the stupidly-named installer of your choice).\\n- RCMRebootInstant will reboot to RCM as soon as it loads.\\n- RCMReboot will give you a 5 second countdown with a chance to change your mind.\\n\\nThe reason RCMReboot is a much bigger file than the Instant version is that I used cpasjuste's cross2d library to put stuff on screen, mostly because I've been using it for the other project I'm working on and it saved me time. Sweet library, check it out.\\n\\nCredits to cpasjuste for the aforementioned cross2d, re.lax for nro2nsp (which uses hacbrewpack by the-4n), SciresM for Atmosphere, libnx, and for fixing the bugs in them I found while making this, and everyone else who worked on Atmosphere, libnx, devkitpro and all that good stuff.\\n\\nSource included for peace of mind, and in case of licence requirement. If I've got anything horribly wrong with licensing or credits just let me know. If you want to build it yourself you'll need libnx updated with the latest commit (which isn't in a release build at the time of writing), and to figure out the cross2d setup for the non-Instant version.",

            "changelog": "0.12.0\\n\\nfusee-primary was last updated in: 0.12.0.\\n\\nWith thanks to the @switchbrew team, Atmosph\u00e8re 0.12.0 is bundled with hbl 2.3.2.\\n\\nThe following was changed since the last release:\\n\\nConfiguration for exosphere was moved to sd:/exosphere.ini.\\nThis is to facilitate BIS protection changes described below.\\nHopefully having this outside of the Atmosphere folder will prevent accidental deletion, since this now contains important settings.\\nAtmosphere's bis protection policy for the PRODINFO partition was substantially reworked.\\nSupport was added for \"automatically\" performing a \"blanking\" operation to PRODINFO without actually modifying NAND.\\nThis is equivalent to using the \"incognito\" homebrew tool, but NAND is never actually modified.\\nThis can be turned on in sysmmc by setting blank_prodinfo_sysmmc=1 in exosphere.ini, and in emummc by setting blank_prodinfo_emummc=1 in exosphere.ini.\\nPlease note: This is not known to be safe. There is a lack of research on whether the information blanked out is cached elsewhere in the system.\\nUsage of this option is not encouraged for this reason.\\nSupport was added for writing to the PRODINFO partition, if a verified encrypted backup has been made.\\nPRODINFO is the only system data that cannot be recovered if not backed up, and thus Atmosphere has backed it up to the SD card on boot for some time now.\\nUsers who wish to modify their calibration data may now do so unconditionally in emummc, and in sysmmc if allow_writing_to_cal_sysmmc=1 is set in exosphere.ini.\\nPlease note: This is heavily discouraged, and the typical user will almost never want to do this.\\nSetting this option will cause Atmosphere to attempt to verify (or create) an encrypted backup of the PRODINFO data to an unused region in the partition.\\nThe backup is encrypted with per-console keys that Atmosphere's developers do not know.\\nIf the backup is not verified or created, writes will not work. Users who have corrupted their PRODINFO in the past are encouraged to flash a good backup to allow use of this setting.\\nReads and writes to the region used for the securely encrypted backup will appear to succeed, but will actually read/write from a buffer filled with garbage in memory.\\nSupport will be investigated in the future for supporting booting with fully blanked calibration.\\nThis is desirable to allow boot to succeed for users who lost their calibration data due to bricking homebrew before bis protection was implemented.\\ncreport has been updated to use the new screenshot APIs added in 9.0.0+.\\nOn 10.0.0+, if a crash occurs in an application (not applet or sysmodule) a screenshot will now be automatically saved to the SD card.\\nIf the user applies a patch to vi on 9.0.0 (as the command this uses was previously for dev-units only), this can also work on 9.0.0.\\nThe new sysmodule pgl added in 10.0.0 was reimplemented.\\npgl (\"Program Launcher\", probably) is responsible for managing launched user-processes, previously this was handled by NS.\\nThe most exciting thing about pgl is that it finally provides an API for multiple clients to subscribe to process events.\\nUsing these new APIs, system modules / other homebrew can subscribe to be notified whenever a process event occurs.\\nThis means action can be taken on process launch, process exit, process crash, etc.\\nA slight concern with Nintendo's implementation is that each subscriber object uses 0x448 bytes of memory, and N only reserves 8KB for all allocations in pgl.\\nAtmosphere's implementation uses a 32KB heap, which should not be exhaustible.\\nAtmosphere's implementation has a total memory footprint roughly 0x28000 bytes smaller than Nintendo's.\\nA reimplementation was added for the jpegdec system module (thanks @HookedBehemoth)!\\nThis allows two sessions instead of 1, so homebrew can now use it for software jpeg decoding in addition to the OS itself.\\nAs usual the implementation has a very slightly smaller memory footprint than Nintendo's.\\ndmnt's Cheat VM was extended to add three new opcodes.\\nThe first new opcode, \"ReadWriteStaticRegister\", allows for cheats to read from a bank of 128 read-only static registers, and write to a bank of 128 write-only static registers.\\nThis can be used in concert with new IPC commands that allow a cheat manager to read or write the value of these static registers to have \"dynamic\" cheats.\\nAs an example, a cheat manager could write a value to a static register that a cheat to control how many of an item to give in a game.\\nAs another example, a cheat manager could read a static register that a cheat writes to to learn how many items a player has.\\nThe second and third opcodes are a pair, \"PauseProcess\" and \"ResumeProcess\".\\nExecuting pause process in a cheat will pause the game (it will be frozen) until a resume process opcode is used.\\nThese are also available over IPC, for cheat managers or system modules that want to pause or resume the attached cheat process.\\nThis allows a cheat to know that the game won't modify or access data the cheat is accessing.\\nFor example, this can be used to prevent Pokemon from seeing a pokemon a cheat is in the middle of injecting and turning it into a bad egg.\\nA bug was fixed that would cause the console to crash when connected to Wi-Fi on versions between 3.0.0 and 4.1.0 inclusive.\\nA bug was fixed that could cause boot to fail sporadically due to cache/tlb mismanagement when doing physical ASLR of the kernel.\\nA number of other minor issues were addressed (and more of Atmosphere was updated to reflect other changes in 10.0.x).\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n0.11.1\\n\\nfusee-primary was last updated in: 0.11.1.\\n\\nWith thanks to the @switchbrew team, Atmosph\u00e8re 0.11.1 is bundled with hbl 2.3.1\\n\\nThe following was changed since the last release:\\n\\nA bug was fixed that could cause owls to flicker under certain circumstances.\\nFor those interested in technical details, in 10.0.0 kernelldr/kernel no longer set cpuactlr_el1, assuming that it was set correctly by the secure monitor.\\nHowever, exosphere did not set cpuactlr_el1. This meant that the register held the reset value going into boot.\\nThis caused a variety of highly erratic symptoms, including causing basically any game to crash seemingly randomly.\\nA number of other major inaccuracies in exosphere were corrected.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n0.11.0\\n\\n0.11.0 is Atmosph\u00e8re's twenty-ninth official release.\\n\\nfusee-primary was last updated in: 0.11.0.\\n\\nPlease note: Atmosph\u00e8re 0.11.0 is currently in pre-release.\\n\\nIf any bugs are reported while Atmosph\u00e8re is in pre-release, they will be fixed and the build will be updated.\\n0.11.0 will transition to release after a short amount of time has passed without pressing bug reports.\\nThe following was changed since the last release:\\n\\nSupport was added for 10.0.0.\\nExosphere has been updated to reflect the new key import semantics in 10.0.0.\\nkernel_ldr now implements physical ASLR for the kernel's backing pages.\\nLoader, NCM, and PM have been updated to reflect the changes Nintendo made in 10.0.0.\\nCreport was updated to use the new pgl service to terminate processes instead of ns:dev.\\nA reimplementation of the erpt (error reports) system module was added.\\nIn previous versions of Atmosphere, a majority of error reports were prevented via a combination of custom creport, fatal, and stubbed eclct.\\nHowever, error reports were still generated via some system actions.\\nMost notably, any time the error applet appeared, an error report was generated.\\nBy default, atmosphere disabled the uploading of error reports, but going online in OFW after an error report occurred in Atmosphere could lead to undesirable telemetry.\\nAtmosphere's erpt reimplementation allows the system to interact with existing error reports as expected.\\nHowever, all new error reports are instead saved to the sd card (/atmosphere/erpt_reports), and are not committed to the system savegame.\\nUsers curious about what kind of telemetry is being prevented can view the reports as they're generated in there.\\nReports are saved as msgpack (as this is what Nintendo uses).\\nPlease note, not all telemetry is disabled. Play reports and System reports will continue to function unmodified.\\nWith atmosphere's erpt implementation, homebrew can now use the native error applet to display errors without worrying about generating undesirable telemetry.\\nlibstratosphere and libvapours received a number of improvements.\\nWith thanks to @Adubbz for his work, the NCM namespace now has client code.\\nThis lays the groundwork for first-class system update/downgrade homebrew support in the near future.\\nIn particular, code implementing the os namespace is significantly more accurate.\\nIn addition, Nintendo's allocators were implemented, allowing for identical memory efficiency versus Nintendo's implementations.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n0.10.5\\n\\nChanges were made to the way fs.mitm builds images when providing a layeredfs romfs.\\nBuilding romfs metadata previously had a memory cost of about ~4-5x the file table size.\\nThis caused games that have particularly enormous file metadata tables (> 4 MB) to exhaust fs.mitm's 16 MB memory pool.\\nThe code that creates romfs images was thus changed to be significantly more memory efficient, again.\\nMemory requirements have been lowered from ~4x file table size to ~2x file table size + 0.5 MB.\\nThere is a slight speed penalty to this, but testing on Football Manager 2020 only took an extra ~1.5 seconds for the game to boot with many modded files.\\nThis shouldn't be noticeable thanks to the async changes made in 0.10.2.\\nIf you encounter a game that exhausts ams.mitm's memory (crashing it) when loading layeredfs mods, please contact SciresM.\\nRomfs building can be made even more memory efficient, but unless games show up with even more absurdly huge file tables it seems not worth the speed trade-off.\\nA bug was fixed that caused Atmosphere's fatal error context to not dump TLS for certain processes.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n0.10.4\\n\\nWith major thanks to @Adubbz for his work, the NCM system module has now been re-implemented.\\nThis was a major stepping stone towards the goal of having implementations of everything in the Switch's package1/package2 firmware.\\nThis also lays the groundwork for libstratosphere providing bindings for changing the installed version of the Switch's OS.\\nPlease Note: The NCM implementation will initially be opt-in.\\nThe Atmosphere team is confident in our NCM implementation (and we have tested it on every firmware version).\\nThat said, this is our first system module that manages NAND savegames -- and caution is a habit.\\nWe do not anticipate any issues that didn't come up in testing, so this is just our being particularly careful.\\nUsers interested in opting in to using our implementation should set stratosphere!ncm_enabled = 1 in BCT.ini.\\nIn the unlikely event that any issues are encountered, please report them to @SciresM.\\nThe NCM implementation will stop being opt-in in a future update, after thorough testing has been done in practice.\\nA bug was fixed in emummc that caused Nintendo path to be corrupted on 1.0.0.\\nThis manifested as the emummc folder being created inside the virtual NAND instead of the SD card.\\nIt's unlikely there are any negative consequences to this in practice.\\nIf you want to be truly sure, you can re-clone sysmmc before updating a 1.0.0 emummc to latest firmware.\\nStratosphere system modules now use new Nintendo-style FS bindings instead of stdio.\\nThis saves a modest amount of memory due to leaner code, and greatly increases the accuracy of several components.\\nThese bindings will make it easier for other system modules using libstratosphere to interact with the filesystem.\\nThis also lays the groundwork for changes necessary to support per-emummc Atmosphere folders in a future update.\\nAtmosphere's fatal error context now dumps 0x100 of TLS.\\nThis will make it much easier to fix bugs when an error report is dumped for whatever caused the crash.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n\\n0.10.3\\n\\nSupport was added for 9.2.0.\\nSupport was added for redirecting manual html content for games.\\nThis works like normal layeredfs, replacing content placed in /atmosphere/contents/<program id>/manual_html/.\\nThis allows for game mods/translations to provide custom manual content, if they so choose.\\nA number of improvements were made to Atmosphere's memory usage, including:\\nfatal now uses STB instead of freetype for rendering.\\nThis saves around 1 MB of memory, and makes our fatal substantially leaner than Nintendo's.\\nsm no longer wastes 2 MiB unnecessarily.\\nfusee/sept's sdmmc access now better matches official behavior.\\nThis improves compatibility with some SD cards.\\nro has been updated to reflect changes made in 9.1.0.\\nThe temporary auto-migration added in 0.10.0 has been removed, since the transitionary period is well over.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n0.10.2\\n\\nhbl configuration was made more flexible.\\nUp to eight specific program ids can now be specified to have their own override keys.\\nThis allows designating both the album applet and a specific game as hbl by default as desired.\\nConfiguration targeting a specific program is now mutually exclusive with override-any-app for that program.\\nThis fixes unintuitive behavior when override key differed for an application specific program.\\nLoader's external content fileystem support was fixed (thanks @misson20000!).\\nKernelLdr was reimplemented.\\nThis is the first step towards developing mesosphere, Atmosphere's planned reimplementation of the Switch's Kernel.\\nThe typical user won't notice anything different, as there are no extensions, but a lot of groundwork was laid for future development.\\nImprovements were made to the way Atmosphere's buildsystem detects source code files.\\nThis significantly reduces compilation time (saving >30 seconds) on the machine that builds official releases.\\nCertain device code was cleaned up and made more correct in fusee/sept/exosphere (thanks @hexkyz!).\\nA number of changes were made to the way fs.mitm builds images when providing a layeredfs romfs.\\nSome games (Resident Evil 6, Football Manager 2020 Touch, possibly others) have enormous numbers of files.\\nAttempting to create a layeredfs mod for these games actually caused fs.mitm to run out of memory, causing a fatal error.\\nThe code that creates these images was changed to be significantly more memory efficient.\\nHowever, these changes also cause a significant slowdown in the romfs building code (~2-5x).\\nThis introduced a noticeable stutter when launching a game, because the UI thread would block on the romfs creation.\\nTo solve this, fs.mitm now lazily initializes the image in a background thread.\\nThis fixes stutter issues, however some games may be slightly slower (~1-2s in the worst cases) to transition from the \"loading\" GIF to gameplay now.\\nPlease note: the slowdown is not noticeable in the common case where games don't have tons of files (typical is ~0.1-0.2 seconds).\\nOnce the image has been built, there is no further speed penalty at runtime -- only when the game is launched.\\nA number of other bugs were fixed, including:\\nSeveral minor logic inversions that could have caused fatal errors when modding games.\\nAtmosphere's new-ipc code did not handle \"automatic\" recvlist buffers correctly, so some non-libnx homebrew could crash.\\nfs.mitm now correctly mitms sdb, which makes redirection of certain system data archives work again.\\nIn 0.10.0/0.10.1, changing the system font/language did not work correctly due to this.\\nA bug was fixed in process cleanup that caused the system to hang on < 5.0.0.\\nThe temporary hid-mitm added in Atmosphere 0.9.0 was disabled by default.\\nPlease ensure your homebrew is updated.\\nFor now, users may re-enable this mitm by use of a custom setting (atmosphere!enable_deprecated_hid_mitm) to ease the transition process some.\\nAs usual, edit the atmosphere section of /atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini if you wish to do so.\\nPlease note: support for this setting may be removed to save memory in a future atmosphere release.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\nFor information on the featureset supported by 0.10.0, please see the official release notes.\\n\\n0.10.1\\n\\nfusee-primary was last updated in: 0.10.0.\\n\\nThe following was changed since the last release:\\n\\nA bug was fixed that caused memory reallocation to the system pool to work improperly on firmware 5.0.0 and above.\\n\\nAtmosphere was always trying to deallocate memory away from the applet pool and towards the system pool.\\nThe intent of this is to facilitate running more custom sysmodules/atmosphere binaries.\\nHowever, while memory was always successfully taken away from the applet pool, on 5.0.0+ granting it to the system pool did not work for technical reasons.\\nIf you are interested in the technical details, talk to SciresM.\\nThis has now been fixed by adding new kernel patches, and memory is correctly granted to the system pool as intended.\\nAtmosphere's library system has been overhauled:\\n\\nlibstratosphere's repository has been rebranded, more generally, to \"Atmosphere-libs\".\\nIn addition to libstratosphere, a new general library for not-stratosphere-specific code has been added.\\nThis is currently named libvapours.\\nIn the future, kernel functionality will be available as libmesosphere.\\nThe build system for stratosphere system modules has been similarly overhauled.\\nThe boot system module is now loaded into non-secure memory.\\n\\nThis helps somewhat to prevent fragmentation of the system memory heap.\\nA number of other bugs were fixed, including:\\n\\nA bug was fixed that could cause memory corruption when redirecting certain Romfs content.\\nA bug was fixed that could cause an infinite loop when redirecting certain Romfs content.\\nA bug was fixed that could cause certain NROs to fail to load.\\nThis caused the latest version of Super Smash Bros to display \"An error has occurred\" on launch.\\nA bug was fixed that caused input/output array sizes for certain circumstances to be calculated incorrectly.\\nThis caused cheats to fail to function properly.\\nC++ exception code is now more thoroughly removed from stratosphere executables.\\nThis saves a minor amount of memory.\\nA number of minor logic inversions were fixed in libstratosphere.\\nThese did not affect any code currently used by released Atmosphere binaries.\\nPlease note: Because this update is releasing so soon after 0.10.0, the removal of the temporary hid-mitm has been postponed to 0.10.2.\\n\\nPlease ensure your homebrew is updated.\\nRandom number generation now uses TinyMT instead of XorShift.\\n\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n\\n0.10.0\\n\\nfusee-primary was last updated in: 0.10.0.\\n\\nPlease note: Atmosph\u00e8re 0.10.0 is currently in pre-release.\\nIf any bugs are reported while Atmosph\u00e8re is in pre-release, they will be fixed and the build will be updated.\\n0.10.0 will transition to release after a short amount of time has passed without pressing bug reports.\\nThe following was changed since the last release:\\n\\nSupport was added for 9.1.0\\nPlease note: The temporary hid-mitm added in Atmosphere 0.9.x will be removed in Atmosphere 0.10.1.\\nPlease ensure your homebrew is updated.\\nThe Stratosphere rewrite was completed.\\nlibstratosphere was rewritten as part of Stratosphere's refactor.\\nCode responsible for providing and managing IPC services was greatly improved.\\nThe new code is significantly more accurate (it is bug-for-bug compatible with Nintendo's code), and significantly faster.\\nams.mitm was rewritten as part of Stratosphere's refactor.\\nSaves redirected to the SD card are now separated for sysmmc vs emummc.\\nPlease note: If you find any bugs, please report them so they can be fixed.\\nThanks to the rewrite, Atmosphere now uses significantly less memory.\\nRoughly 10 additional megabytes are now available for custom system modules to use.\\nThis means you can potentially run more custom system modules simultaneously.\\nIf system modules are incompatible, please ask their authors to reduce their memory footprints.\\nAtmosphere's configuration layout has had major changes.\\nConfiguration now lives inside /atmosphere/config/.\\nAtmosphere code now knows what default values should be, and includes them in code.\\nIt is no longer an error if configuration inis are not present.\\nCorrespondingly, Atmosphere no longer distributes default configuration inis.\\nTemplates are provided in /atmosphere/config_templates.\\nloader.ini was renamed to override_config.ini.\\nThis fixes the longstanding problem that atmosphere updates overwrote user configuration when extracted.\\nAtmosphere's process override layout was changed.\\nAtmosphere now uses the /atmosphere/contents directory, instead of /atmosphere/titles.\\nThis goes along with a refactoring to remove all reference to \"title id\" from code, as Nintendo does not use the term.\\nTo make this transition easier, a temporary functionality has been added that migrates folders to the new directory.\\nWhen booting into 0.10.0, Atmosphere will rename /atmosphere/titles/<program id> to /atmosphere/contents/<program id>.\\nThis functionality may or may not be removed in some future update.\\nThis should solve any transition difficulties for the typical user.\\nPlease make sure that any future mods you install extract to the correct directory.\\nSupport for configuring override keys for hbl was improved.\\nThe key used to override applications versus a specific program can now be different.\\nThe key to override a specific program can be managed via override_key.\\nThe key to override any app can be managed via override_any_app_key.\\nDefault override behavior was changed.\\nBy default, atmosphere will now override the album applet with hbl unless R is held.\\nBy default, atmosphere will now override any application with hbl only if R is held.\\nThe default amount of applet memory reserved has been slightly increased.\\nThis allows the profile selector applet to work by default in applet mode.\\nThe way process override status is captured was changed.\\nProcess override keys are now captured exactly once, when the process is created.\\nThis fixes the longstanding issue where letting go of the override button partway into the process launch could cause problems.\\nThe Mitm API was changed to pass around override status.\\nMitm services now know what keys were held when the client was created, as well as whether the client is HBL/should override contents.\\nAn extension was added to pm:info to allow querying a process's override status.\\nThanks to process override capture improvements, hbl html behavior has been greatly improved.\\nWeb applets launched by hbl will now always see the /atmosphere/hbl_html filesystem\\nSupport was added to exosphere for enabling usermode access to the PMU registers.\\nThis can be controlled via exosphere!enable_user_pmu_access in BCT.ini.\\nAn enormous number of minor bugs were fixed.\\ndmnt's cheat VM had a fix for an inversion in opcode behavior.\\nAn issue was fixed in fs.mitm's management of domain object IDs that could lead to system corruption in rare cases.\\nThe Mitm API no longer silently fails when attempting to handle commands passing C descriptors.\\nOn previous atmosphere versions, certain commands to FS would silently fail due to this...\\nNo users reported any visible errors, but it was definitely a problem behind the scenes.\\nThese commands are now handled correctly.\\nAtmosphere can now display a fatal error screen significantly earlier in the boot process, if things go wrong early on.\\nThe temporary hid mitm will no longer sometimes cause games to fail to detect input.\\nMitm Domain object ID management no longer desynchronizes from the host process.\\nAn issue was fixed that could cause service acquisition to hang forever if certain sm commands were called in a precise order.\\nAn off-by-one was fixed that could cause memory corruption in server memory management.\\n... and too many more bugs fixed to reasonably list them all :)\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n\\n0.9.4\\n\\nfusee-primary was last updated in: 0.9.3.\\n\\nThe following was changed since the last release:\\n\\nSupport was added for 9.0.0.\\nPlease note: 9.0.0 made a number of changes that may cause some issues with homebrew. Details:\\n9.0.0 changed HID in a way that causes libnx to be unable to detect button input.\\nHomebrew should be recompiled with newest libnx to fix this.\\nAtmosphere now provides a temporary hid-mitm that will cause homebrew to continue to work as expected.\\nThis mitm will be removed in a future Atmosphere revision once homebrew has been updated, to allow users to use a custom hid mitm again if they desire.\\n9.0.0 introduced an dependency in FS on the USB system module in order to launch the SD card.\\nThis means the USB system module must now be launched before the SD card is initialized.\\nCorrespondingly, the USB system module can no longer be IPS patched, and its settings cannot be reliably mitm'd.\\nWe know this is frustrating, so we'll be looking into whether there is some way of addressing this in the future.\\nPlease note: 9.0.0 updated the switch's gamecart controller (\"lotus\") firmware.\\nTo prevent the burning of lotus fuses, Atmosphere now applies nogc patches when booting into 9.0.0 with fuses below 9.0.0.\\nIf you wish to play gamecarts on 9.0.0 (but forever prevent yourself from playing them on < 9.0.0), set nogc = 0 in BCT.ini.\\nAn off-by-one error was fixed in boot system module's pinmux initialization.\\nThis could theoretically have caused issues with HdmiCec communication.\\nNo users reported issues, so it's unclear if this was a problem in practice.\\nA bug was fixed that could cause webapplet launching homebrew to improperly set the accessible url whitelist.\\nBIS key generation has been fixed for newer hardware.\\nNewer hardware uses new, per-firmware device key to generate BIS keys instead of the first device key, so previously the wrong keys were generated as backup.\\nThis only affects units manufactured after ~5.0.0.\\nGeneral system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\\n",

The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley.

Yellow Disks do not fall yet may be pushed in any direction, but not pulled (which allows creating Sokoban-like puzzles), and explode when the Terminal is used. Red Disks can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.\\n\\nSupaplex is the first Boulder Dash-like game that is not fully grid-based: while the playing field is an obvious grid, the objects do not 'snap' from one grid position to another, but can be halfway or 'in between' grid positions while moving or falling. This behavior has led to a number of well-known bugs that can be turned to the player's advantage, many of which need to be exploited to complete fan-made levels. For instance, by turning around quickly, the player can cause an enemy or rock to 'bounce' off Murphy.\\n\\nThe game also applies 'gravity' on some levels, which means that Murphy will fall down empty spaces and will be unable to go back up, unless he climbs up by using bases. Gravity is not actually designated - the player can only notice via trial-and-error.\\n\\nControls:\\nUp/Down/Left/Right: left joystick or directional pad\\nRemoving bases/infotrons next to Murphy: Y button + direction\\nDetonate red disk: hold Y button\\nExit/back: B button",

Play at your own risk.\\n\\nKnown issues\\nThe game takes a long time to load.\\nPerformance is quite bad, especially on some levels, which seems to mostly be caused by dynamic lights.\\nThe stock demos desync. I'm not sure if this is because this is technically version 1.10 and those are from 1.07, or because of something I did.\\nBecause this is version 1.10 and most PC servers run 1.07, you can't connect to them. Not sure if I can just change the version number to 1.07, since that might cause desync if there are any significant differences.\\nLow framerate/broken timing in menus.\\nYou can't control the NETRICSA menus (except for quitting them with the PLUS button).\\nNotes\\nThis probably requires full RAM access, so don't run it from the Album.\\nIf the game hangs at the first NETRICSA screen, that means it's still loading, wait a few seconds.\\nI have enabled the \"Precache shadowmaps\" option by default, which results in less lag in game, but significantly increases load times. If you don't want that, you can disable it in \"Advanced options\" -> \"Rendering options\".\\nYou can turn dynamic lights off for a performance increase by setting shd_iAllowDynamic in Scripts/PersistentSymbols.ini to 0, but beware: dynamic lights are an integral part of some levels.\\nYou can bring up the console by pressing MINUS.

This simplifies the code, and fixes potential issues? old libnx could have had.\\n\\nSome parts of the code were rewritten or simplified, in order to try to improve Goldleaf's performance. A lot of nonsense or unused code was removed, and much stuff was simplified thanks to latest libnx changes.\\n\\nRemoved forwarder support. There are less ban-baity ways to launch homebrew as applications (via uLaunch or using Atmosphere's title override)\\n\\nApplication\\nFixed a bug where deleting the currently selected user would leave Goldleaf in a buggy state (because it would still think that the user is valid)\\n\\nNow amiibo dumping is done via \"debug\" amiibo/NFP services. Since emuiibo intercepts user (and soon system) services, using debug services means Goldleaf will be able to dump real amiibos even if emuiibo is activated.\\n\\nCustom exception/crash handling: now, when a crash happens (usually segmentation faults), it won't cause a fatal error, Goldleaf will instead save a simple crash report to /reports and exit normally. Same thing for fatal crashes, which also log fatal reports there.\\n\\nNow rebooting will reboot to RCM/payload, same way as if you rebooted from HOME menu's power menu.\\n\\nThe web browser system was improved, adding now a custom menu, and the possibility to save a page as a bookmark after having browsed it.\\n\\nAdded an integrated emuiibo v0.4.0 manager! This simplifies a lot using virtual amiibos:\\n\\nUnlike other managers, Goldleaf checks the amiibo and attempts to get its picture from AmiiboAPI, otherwise displays a default icon.\\n\\nYou can change emuiibo's status (on, on for one use and off) and select a certain amiibo to use.\\n\\nv0.7.3\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\nNow the console's supported key generation is read from BOOT0 (it was hardcoded manually before) - this means that Goldleaf won't have to be updated in new console updates to fix key mismatch errors! Thus, 9.0.1 support was also fixed.\\nUpdates\\n\\nGoldleaf's updater is broken on 0.7.2 (and probably lower versions). PLEASE, DON'T USE IT TO UPDATE TO 0.7.3!. Luckily, it is fixed for this version, so next versions (0.7.x, 0.8...) should download fine when they get released soon.\\n\\nPending update detection was barely broken, but has been fixed too. As mentioned in previous releases, you can export it to install it safely with ChoiDujourNX, and delete it from system after that.\\n\\nv0.7.2\\n\\nQuick bugfix\\n\\nv0.7.1\\n\\n9.0.0 support was added.\\n\\nIntroducing a new, properly made PC client: Quark! (since Goldtree was made as quick as possible, I've wanted to remake it from scratch since 0.1...)\\n\\nQuark is going to be Goldtree's new replacement.\\n\\nIt's Java and cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux and Mac.\\n\\nIt has a fancy, Material-style UI, which you can interact with while USB is handled in the background.\\n\\nNote that it's still experimental! You will need JRE/JDK 8u60 or higher to use it.\\n\\nConsole information layout has been remade into a new layout, introducing some new cool and QoL features:\\n\\nA new menu allows to view the current console update's version, plus an option to export it!\\n\\nIn case the console has a pending update downloaded (when the system auto-downloads an update) it can also be exported or removed, so that booting into Maintenance menu isn't neccessary to do so.\\n\\nUpdates can be exported in directory (to be later installed with Choi) or in NSP form.\\n\\nTitle exporting\\n\\nNSP generating code was rewritten from scratch, what might involve performance improvements.\\n\\nExported contents' directory was moved to /dump/title since update are exported to /dump/update\\n\\nv0.7.0\\n\\n===Remote PC===\\n\\nUnicode is now supported. No more complaints with special characters in drive labels or folders!\\n\\nRead size was dropped again to 8MB (from previous 16MB), to make USB more stable (16MB size might cause unstability)\\n\\nAdded option to select a file directly on the remote PC tool (basically same system as on <=0.5 Goldleaf versions, for those who like the classic system!)\\n\\nGoldtree's messages were slightly changed to be more accurate. Now it shows its version to avoid confusion between different executables.\\n\\n===NSP installs===\\n\\nThe NSP's name is shown above (instead of the directory).\\n\\nETA (estimated time for the install to finish) is now shown too.\\n\\nNow Goldleaf always obtains the NSP's key generation (previously only when it had a ticket) and compares it to a computed system one, in order to block installs with higher key generations (mostly since the contents couldn't be decryptable, thus utterly useless)\\n\\nNow install location is just chosen once, at the start of batch NSP installs (all NSPs within a directory)\\n\\nMulti-content installations (just a few titles currently) work now (didn't seem to work on 0.6.x)\\n\\n===Title dump / export===\\n\\nTitles are always dumped inside concatenation files (HOS's archive bit directories, used to support +4GB files), what means +4GB titles can safely be dumped on FAT32, and directly installed.\\n\\nFixed errors dumping updates and DLCs. They should work fine now.\\n\\n===General===\\n\\nA big part of the code was reformatted: several small bugs fixed, others not that small mentioned below.\\n\\nAdded a warning and success / failure messages for directory deleting.\\n\\nGoldleaf no longer relies on its custom libnx fork, since its only worthy difference was its (slightly) custom USB code, which has been merged in Goldleaf. This doesn't involve any performance changes, but less complexity in order to build the project.\\n\\nCopying files from PC to SD which are over 4GB is now correctly handled, creating a concatenation file (see above) to correctly handle it.\\n\\nThe forwarder was updated with hbloader's latest version, thus now the forwarder's version is 0.2.\\n\\n===User / accounts===\\n\\nUsers have a more important role in Goldleaf. Now an account has to be selected in order to use several user-related features.\\n\\nAdded support for unlinking (locally ONLY) accounts, mainly for banned people who want to unlink their accounts in order to delete them.\\n\\n===Content manager===\\n\\nFixed a bug where the base title's size would be shown always, even when checking only updates or DLC.\\n\\nAdded play statistics support, both for user-only (user must be selected first, see above) and global, this includes last played time and total play time for both.\\n\\nFixed bugs where contents whose base title is on a different location than updates/DLCs would be shown incorrecly.\\n\\n===UI===\\n\\nUnicode changes stated above\\n\\nThe system's shared font is no longer used, due to its lack of unicode characters. Instead, a new font is used from now on: Roboto (medium), aka Android's standard font.\\n\\nTwo new clickable icons have been added to the bottom right side of Goldleaf's top banner: one for user selection, while the other one for help and control information.\\n\\nSome small corrections made: size adjustments, with no connection no IP or default text will be shown from now on.\\n\\nPlutonium corrections with newlines and text sizes make dialog sizes more well measured now (previously, a single newline would make the dialog as wide as the entire screen)\\n\\nSeveral icon changes (forwarder's icon and amiibo dump), thanks to C4Phoenix for all his help with graphic resources since 0.1!\\n\\nGoldleaf now has been compiled with an experimental Plutonium branch which uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers aiming no memory leaks!\\n\\nNow, Goldleaf also supports dutch language! Thanks a lot to Mega for helping with the translation!\\n\\nv0.6.1\\n\\nFixed bugs present in 0.6:\\n\\n+4GB files are correctly handled now by the USB (remote PC) system\\n\\nNow Italian language works fine (strings were missing, what made Goldleaf insta-crash)\\n\\nInstalling a NSP to console memory would later open the file for hex viewing (now fixed and nothing else is done after install)\\n\\nNew features:\\n\\nInstall sizes (MB/s) are now accurately reported, with decimal values\\n\\nWeb browser can only be used launched from the forwarder (previously any application would work)\\n\\nThe forwarder was not updated. Goldtree received few string changes and more changes in order to fix +4GB file issues.\\n\\nv0.6\\n\\n(My god, it's been 4 months!)\\n\\nNSP installs:\\n\\nAs Goldleaf's internal filesystem handling has been completely remade, installs have been internally remade. This apparently results in slightly faster installs, at least in my case.\\n\\nNow the user won't be asked to ignore required firmware version or not, as that can be configured on the config.\\n\\nSleep-mode is disabled now in order to avoid to interrupt installs.\\n\\nNow all the NSPs inside a directory can be installed in a row (see below).\\n\\nUSB installs:\\n\\nUSB installs have been improved into a new feature: remote PC browser!\\n\\nNow you can directly browse your PC, plus any drives connected to it, as a regular filesystem, same as SD card or console memory.\\n\\nIt is also worth to mention that the new USB command system seems to be way, WAY more stable than any previous USB system in Goldleaf!\\n\\nAnyway, always keep in mind that it might freeze or cause bugs with folders with tons of files.\\n\\nFile systems:\\n\\nPresenting the new, remade USB system: remote PC browsing!\\n\\nInstead of a simple connection, it's a whole filesystem implementation over USB.\\n\\nBrowse your PC (Windows-only with Goldtree) directly from Goldleaf! Any extra drive inserted browsable by the PC will be browsable here.\\n\\nSince USB drives' support (fsp-usb service in Atmosphere) is still being worked on, you can use this system with drives inserted in your PC in order to browse or install files from there.\\n\\nTwo simple, QoL features have been added to filesystems (to directories in this case): the option to install all NSPs within the directory, and the option to set the archive bit on it.\\n\\nUI\\n\\nFor now on, Goldleaf main color will continue to be golden, but the \"secondary\" color along with gold is going to be blue.\\n\\nTherefore, both the icon and the main themes have been changed.\\n\\nGoldleaf auto-updating:\\n\\nNow Goldleaf supports updating itself, since https was supported on dkP. (this means direct access to GitHub for version checking and asset downloading)\\n\\nNevertheless, now Goldleaf's NSP is a forwarder, what means that just by updating the NRO you will target Goldleaf from HOME menu as always.\\n\\nYou can even upgrade the installed version if you want to!\\n\\nAs you may suppose, this requires internet connection :)\\n\\nAmiibo dumping support\\n\\nA new option has been added to the main menu, which adds support to dump real amiibos to be used with emuiibo.\\n\\nObviously, emuiibo 0.3 format is used. Please ensure you're also using the latest emuiibo version!\\n\\nv0.5\\nHuge UI refactor\\nUSB is in a better state now\\nNew and rebuilt content manager\\n\\nv0.4\\n\\nAtmosph\u00e8re v0.8.3's new feature, payload rebooting from the console itself, is also supported by Goldleaf! Binary *.bin files will have an option to be launched as payloads if Atmosph\u00e8re is detected running.\\n\\nThe old title manager has been refactored. Now, it can show ANY kind of content located in any partition, from system data archives to DLCs and updates, and regular titles. All of them can be removed individually.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability to detect the CFW currently running, which gets displayed on the CFW menu.\\n\\nNow the web browser is accessible even if Goldleaf isn't an installed title. It will use the WifiLogin web-applet, which has some limitations, but at least it's something.\\n\\nContent mounting (like NAND when being browsed or the NSPs when being installed) has been refactored to minimize any filesystem issues.\\n\\nSome icons were changed: NROs have a new icon, NCAs have now the old NROs icon...\\n\\nNSP exporting now warns with titles which are 4GB or higher, for risk preventing.\\n\\nUSB has been quite improved with experimental threads' syncing, which seems to make it more stable.\\n\\nRegular installs check for free size now.\\n\\nTickets show if they're used or not, so unused ones should be safe to remove.\\n\\nBoth USB and regular installations abort if the title is already installed.\\n\\nMinor fixes and corrections on texts and several options.\\n\\nv0.3\\n\\nNow it's checked that the base folders inside \"sd:/goldleaf\" are created before entering certain menus.\\n\\nFile browsers won't refresh the current directory's contents after copying a file as it was pointless and caused delay.\\n\\nThis version of Goldleaf supports libnx v2.0.0, which fixed a few bugs with USB, and also added native keyboard support.\\n\\nNow files and directories can be renamed in file browsers using the native keyboard.\\n\\nNow new files or directories can be created (files will be empty) by pressing L (for files) or R (for directories) in a file browser.\\n\\nNow the star feature, NSP dumping! This is quite experimental though, and could be unstable. Be careful using it!\\n\\nAnother console memory partition can be browsed appart from the three others: PRODINFOF\\n\\nBrief information about the different partitions is displayed when selecting the console memory browser.\\n\\nThe path of the key file has been moved from \"sd:/goldleaf/\" to \"sd:/switch/\" as other homebrews use this path.\\n\\nAfter removing tickets no dialog will be shown, the footer will inform of the process instead.\\n\\nThe top part of Goldleaf has been redesigned, which has a mini-text for the current menu. (e.g. current directory in SD card or console memory browsers)\\n\\nA warning dialog is displayed selecting USB installation as it's quite unstable for the moment.\\n\\nFixed small bugs with SD card NSP installation.\\n\\nNow file/directory copying has a progress bar to follow the copy process, instead of freezing the UI.\\n\\nWEB BROWSER! Yeah, you've read right, Goldleaf is the first homebrew tool to provide support for the console's internal browser.\\n\\nAccount manager! You can replace user's icon, delete them or rename them. Anyway, replacing the icon can be dangerous and banbait!\\n\\nNow no cert files are required to install a ticket, not even with NSP installs or USB installs. Goldleaf contains the public cert directly.\\n\\nMinor fixes on several dialogs and texts.\\n\\nv0.2\\n\\nSupposedly, now those random crashes browsing menus or filesystems are fixed now.\\n\\nWhen looking for the key file for NCAs or themes, now more names are supported (not just keys.dat): keys.dat, prod.keys, keys.txt or keys.ini.\\n\\nFixed bug which would not install the selected theme if qlaunch was not extracted, and it would just extract it without processing the theme.\\n\\nNow title 0100000000001013 is installed to qlaunch directory, previously user page themes wouldn't work for this issue.\\n\\nv0.1\\n\\nFirst Release",

            "details": "Easy-to-use title installer & manager for Nintendo Switch\\n\\nIf you are looking for Tinfoil, this is Tinfoil's safer and way more extended evolution.\\nBrief description\\nGoldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing,\\n\\nYou can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.\\n\\nIf you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project for Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nInstalling NSP packages can be dangerous.\\n\\nKeep in mind that there will always be a ban risk, and that NSPs with tickets are specially dangerous.\\n\\nIf you want to be safe, avoid connecting to the internet via airplane mode, or block Nintendo's services via special tools such as 90DNS.\\n\\nGoldleaf simply provides support for a normal NSP and/or ticket installation. The way you use them or the risks you are taking are your problem.\\n\\nGoldleaf gives the user the possibility to modify NAND files, by deleting them or allowing to copy new files there.\\n\\nThis can be dangerous, as deleting NCAs from the NAND contents can lead to unfixable errors. Image deleting all the EXE and DLL files from System32 folder. Well, the result would be similar.\\n\\nRemoving tickets from installed contents will make the system not to be able to recognise them as \"legit\" purchased, so it will refuse to launch them (in many cases, but NOT all cases)\\n\\nMain features\\nSD card and NAND browser\\n\\nA very simple but, in my opinion, one of the most useful features in Goldleaf. Just a file browser for the SD card or for NAND partitions, providing special support for some file formats:\\n\\nNSP (Nintendo Submission Package)\\n\\nIt's the official format used by Nintendo to provide installable content from their CDN servers.\\n\\nTechnically, it's a PFS0 (a simple file format containing several files) with NCA contents, sometimes XML and/or icon metadata (exported by official packaging tools), and a ticket and a cert in case they are signed with a titlekey (games are, system contents aren't).\\n\\nGoldleaf can install NSPs same way other official apps would, like DevMenu.\\n\\nAs a warning, I do not recommend installing NSPs in case you plan to go online. Installing content from unofficial tools (such as Goldleaf or the old Tinfoil) can lead to permanent bans from online services, and in severe cases, from every Nintendo service, even from updating the console or games. Install NSPs at your own risk.\\n\\nNRO (Nintendo Relocatable Object)\\n\\nOfficially is treated as a dynamic library object, similar to DLLs on Windows. This are loaded dynamically by applications at runtime.\\n\\nHomebrew uses them as executable binaries because as they can contain multiple data sections, we can use them to load extra info such as NACP (title, author and version), an icon, or even RomFs data to access at runtime.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability of launching NROs located at the SD card. Keep in mind that this feature usually can cause undefined behavior due to some difficulties cleaning up graphics so quickly.\\n\\nNCA (Nintendo Content Archive)\\n\\nThis format is the base format used by Horizon OS to store content.\\n\\nWhile the previously mentioned formats don't require any kind of cryptography to be extracted or used, NCAs have to be decrypted, so the user is required to provide the required keys to extract the content.\\n\\nNCAs have different sections, as well as other information. The two main sections are the ExeFs and RomFs: the ExeFs filesystem contains the code NSO binaries and a NPDM metadata file, while the RomFs contains different files to be accessed from the title.\\n\\nSome NCAs could also contain a special section, which is the section 0. This section contains the PNG and GIF logos displayed at the top-left and botton-right of the console when launching a title.\\n\\nNCAs don't have neccessarily those two sections. The program NCA, the base of any application or applet, will contain an ExeFs, and usually a RomFs in case it's a game or a system title with resources like settings or Home Menu.\\n\\nAppart from program NCAs there are some other NCA types: control NCA (NACP and icons), legalinfo NCA (HTML manuals and information), offline NCA (HTML documents in case the title wants to load them) content meta CNMT NCA (with title specific information)...\\n\\nGoldleaf has embedded hactool in his code, so it can extract those partitions from NCAs, if the keys are provided.\\n\\nNXTheme (Home Menu theme)\\n\\nThis format is developed by Qcean team, a format to handle Home Menu layout modding.\\n\\n+Goldleaf can install them, but it needs to have Home Menu's RomFs at sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch. If the keys used with other formats are provided, Goldleaf itself will locate the console's qlaunch and extract it to that directory.\\n\\nYou will have to reboot with CFW after installing a theme to see any changes.\\n\\nNACP (Nintendo Application Control Property)\\n\\nThis is the format used by Nintendo to store a title's name, version, author name and other information, like if the title supports screnshots or video captures.\\n\\nGoldleaf can parse a NACP file and display some of it's information.\\n\\nTickets and certificates\\n\\nTickets (.tik) and certificates (.cert) are the format used by Nintendo to provide encryption data for titlekey-signed titles (almost every game).\\n\\nNSPs usually contain them, and Goldleaf can install them if they are located in the SD card.\\n\\nTo install a ticket you will have to provide a certificate, both with the same name and in the same directory, with their extension. (example: sd:/game.tik and sd:/game.cert)\\n\\nThe NAND browser has almost the same support, but it's reccomended to use it only to export files via copying them to the SD card, to avoid any trouble. Goldleaf should warn when doing dangerous operations anyway.\\n\\nUSB installer and Goldtree\\n\\nYou can install NSPs via USB using Goldtree, a C# PC client to handle this installations.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB installations are a bit unstable, and might bug sometimes.\\n\\nTitle manager\\n\\nGoldleaf's title manager will display all the titles installed in the system, both SD, NAND and the one in the gamecart if inserted.\\n\\nYou can view these titles' information, icon, install location and Application Id.\\n\\nTitles can also be completely uninstalled here. Keep in mind that deleting a title won't delete its savedata, that should stay on the system.\\n\\nTicket manager\\n\\nGoldleaf can get all the tickets installed on the console. While some of them will contain the name of the title they belong to, some could belong to DLC or other types of content despite not belonging directly to a title.\\n\\nYou can view the Application Id and the key generation of a ticket by selecting it.\\n\\nTickets can also be removed from the console. Removing tickets can be a dangerous option, as without them, titlekey-signed won't be allowed to boot by Home Menu.\\n\\nCFW configuration\\n\\nThis is mostly a useful menu for checking which CFWs are in the SD card and whichof them have any Home Menu modifications, meaning that a theme is probably installed there.\\n\\nYou can delete any Home Menu modifications of a certain CFW after selecting a CFW.\\n\\nConsole information\\n\\nOn this option, you can check the used size of the SD card, the entire NAND, and on the different NAND partitions.\\n\\nIt also displays the current firmware version the console is.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nDisplays Goldleaf's logo and whether Goldleaf is running as a NRO from hbmenu or as a normal title.\\n\\nAs some other miscellaneous options, you can easily reboot or shut down your console from Goldleaf, by pressing ZL or ZR in any moment.\\n\\nProviding keys\\nIf you provide a file with several Switch keys (commonly named as prod.keys or keys.dat) you will be able to do some extra stuff with Goldleaf: (remember that you have to place it as sd:/goldleaf/keys.dat)\\n\\nUnless you already have dumped qlaunch's (aka Home Menu) RomFs (or at least the files within lyt folder) in sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch directory, you will need to provide the previously mentioned key file with several keys, so that Goldleaf can extract directly the RomFs of the console's qlaunch contents to use it.\\n\\nYou have the option to extract NCA contents (ExeFs, RomFs or section 0), but you will need the previously mentioned keys too.\\n\\nGoldtree and USB installs\\nUSB communication is slightly different from Tinfoil's one, so Tinfoil's old Python script, AluminumFoil nor other tools won't work properly.\\n\\nGoldtree will ask you to choose a NSP after establishing connection with Goldleaf, and it will be received and installed by Goldleaf.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB support is a bit unstable, and sometimes it might fail. Anyway, it should work most of the times.\\n\\nBasic controls\\nThe controls are quite intuitive in Goldleaf, but here you have a brief explanation of them:\\n\\nPress A to select options from menus, browse folders, or in case it's a file, to browse a menu with file options (copy, delete...)\\n\\nPress B to cancel a dialog or to go back to the previous page / menu.\\n\\nPress X to paste the path of the clipboard. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress Y to browse a menu with directory options, similar to the one used with files, instead of browsing the directory. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress ZL or ZR anywhere to browse a menu with reboot / shut down options, in case you want to reboot or shut down the console.\\n\\nPress Plus (+) or Minus (-) to exit Goldleaf and return to hbmenu. This option is only available if Goldleaf is loaded as a NRO binary. (more special cases like this one below)\\n\\nMovement is quite obvious. Using the L-stick, the R-stick or the D-pad you can move through menu or dialog options. On menus (like the file browsers or the main menu) the R-stick provides a way faster scrolling.\\n\\nSpecial features\\nGoldleaf differs on some features depending on whether it is loaded as a NRO or as an installed title:\\n\\nGoldleaf can be exited via Plus (+) or Minus (-) buttons if it's loaded as a NRO, but as regular titles have to be exited from the Home Menu, this feature is not available as a title.\\n\\nGoldleaf disables Home button pressing while installing a NSP if it's loaded as a title, but this feature isn't available as a NRO binary for technical reasons related to applets.\\n\\nGoldleaf cannot launch NRO binaries if it's loaded as a title due to technical reasons. They can only be launched from another NRO binary.\\n\\nIssues and support\\nIn case you find a bug or you need help with Goldleaf, you have several places to ask.\\n\\nMany errors are very common and can be misunderstood, and you should document a bit for some errors instead of directly calling them issues:\\n\\nIt's a common issue for some NSPs, although they are completely valid ones, being detected as wrong NSPs. Although they can be really wrong NSPs, it is usually caused by firmware mismatch. For instance, in case you are trying to install a title which requires at least 5.1.0 version (which uses key generation 4) on a lower firmware version, it won't be recognised as a valid NSP for cryptographical reasons. (the console cannot decrypt the NSP because it is encrypted with unknown keys which are within 5.1.0 update)\\n\\nThe USB installation can sometimes freeze in the middle of the install. If that happens, try closing Goldleaf and Goldtree, uninstalling the wrongly-installed title and retrying.",

Thanks @shchmue.\\nAdditionally, heap management became more robust and fragments way less often.\\nAdded support for entering fastboot on Android.\\nThis requires of pressing VOL+ first and while holding it, also start holding VOL-.\\nExternal patches only look for patches.ini now\\nThe reason is that patches_template.ini is now useless and no one should install homebrew when title replacement exists.\\nAlso because apparently it confuses users into thinking that it takes precedence over patches.ini, even though it explained countless of times that it's only loaded if patches.ini is not found.\\nLastly there's a confusion where users thought that empty patches is not the same with no patches, even though it's exactly the same.

For now this can only patch KIPs defined in hekate's code, with whatever new patches. Next versions will support other KIPs.\\nMany bugfixes\\n\\nNyx v0.8.0\\n\\nSnappy and fluid GUI w/ touch support\\nYes! This runs on BPMP!\\nAll classic launch options are there\\nemuMMC manage\\nChange between raw partition emuMMCs and SD file based ones easily.\\nCreate file based or raw partition based from eMMC via the Create button.\\nYou can also restore a backup directly to sd partition via the Restore option in tools (outside of emuMMC), AFTER you turned ON SD emuMMC Raw Partition.\\nMigrate other types of emunand (raw partition or sd file), repair existing raw partition configurations, or migrate a backup (outside of restore folder), to sd file based.\\nEverything is currently made to protect Linux partitions.\\nAdditionally, the raw partition based is done in 16MB offset, so it can protected from quick formats.\\nAll Info and Tools are now supercharged\\nDump individual kips from eMMC, see detailed info about fuses, do backups and restores way faster, etc.\\nCustomization support\\nCustom icons for boot entries and also a background is supported.

For as long as rebuilding the boot process takes.\\nSmarter versioning for update.bin and sept payloads\\nNow it supports hotfix versions and it's still compatible with old hekate versions.\\nSept is now updated via hekate's copy in IRAM. This negates the mandatory usage of update.bin and it copies always the most updated version.\\nAdditionally if sept/payload.bin is found that it's foreign, it is renamed and hekate takes its place for running sept. After that it renames the original payload back and continues with booting.\\ndebugmode is now obsolete for atmosphere. It's enabled by default.\\nSome nasty stack corruption bugs were fixed\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nNOTE: You will need sept and a custom warmboot binary to boot 7.X.X.\\n\\nv4.8\\n\\nFull 7.0.0/7.0.1 support.\\nThe keys are generated via Atmosph\u00e8re's sept.\\nAdditionally the sept/payload.bin, if found that it is hekate, it gets updated via update.bin.\\nReboot to a selected boot entry via HOS hb\\nYou can now force a boot configuration on hekate by setting the boot storage in the hekate binary.\\nThis can be done via a homebrew, which sets the ini entry that is desired to boot.\\nAdditionally force boot to menu can also be achieved.

Play at your own risk.\\n\\nKnown issues\\nThe game takes a long time to load.\\nPerformance is quite bad, especially on some levels, which seems to mostly be caused by dynamic lights.\\nThe stock demos desync. I'm not sure if this is because this is technically version 1.10 and those are from 1.07, or because of something I did.\\nBecause this is version 1.10 and most PC servers run 1.07, you can't connect to them. Not sure if I can just change the version number to 1.07, since that might cause desync if there are any significant differences.\\nLow framerate/broken timing in menus.\\nYou can't control the NETRICSA menus (except for quitting them with the PLUS button).\\nNotes\\nThis probably requires full RAM access, so don't run it from the Album.\\nIf the game hangs at the first NETRICSA screen, that means it's still loading, wait a few seconds.\\nI have enabled the \"Precache shadowmaps\" option by default, which results in less lag in game, but significantly increases load times. If you don't want that, you can disable it in \"Advanced options\" -> \"Rendering options\".\\nYou can turn dynamic lights off for a performance increase by setting shd_iAllowDynamic in Scripts/PersistentSymbols.ini to 0, but beware: dynamic lights are an integral part of some levels.\\nYou can bring up the console by pressing MINUS. Press A to enter commands.\\nPlay around with the Scripts/PersistentSymbols.ini file and Advanced rendering settings. I still haven't figured out the optimal configuration.\\nIf the game crashes, take a look at the log file in the game folder (ssam_tfe/ssam_tfe.log or ssam_tse/ssam_tse.log).",

Time was only used by logs anyway. They use system tick-based time now.\\n\\n0.6.1\\n\\nFixed an issue that caused version 0.6.0 to always use 100% of CPU core 3\\nThe sysmodule will now detect both versions of Dualshock 4 controllers at the same time (thanks @p-sam again)\\nAs such, the config option for it has been removed\\nChanged how controller configs work:\\nAdded separate options for both Left trigger deadzone and Right trigger deadzone.\\nController key mapping now supports multimapping, aka mapping multiple keys to the same button.\\nAdditionally, you can also disable a key entirely, by writing KEY_* = NONE.\\nPreviously, a line key_SYNC = LSTICK_CLICK would make the Sync/Capture button press the Left stick button, and make the Left stick button press the Capture button.\\nThis has been changed, so that this would only modify the Sync/Capture button. The Left stick button would still press the left stick button.\\nThe syntax has also been changed to KEY_CAPTURE = LSTICK_CLICK.\\n\\n0.6.0\\n\\nThis is a temporary release that i'm pressured to publish due to all the underlying issues that are still present on earlier versions. The \"actual\" 0.6.0 release will come at a later point.\\n\\nChangelog\\nThe sysmodule codebase has been rewritten to use libstratosphere.\\nThis will make it easier in the future to allow other homebrew to directly communicate with sys-con.\\nThe code now also looks a little bit cleaner :)\\nFixed an issue introduced by v0.5.2 causing the system to completely freeze when left in sleep mode with a controller plugged in.\\nFixed an issue introduced by v0.5.2 causing sys-con to not recognize more than 2-3 controllers simultaneously.\\n(Hopefully) fixed an issue causing controllers to be no longer recognized until sys-con is restarted.\\nThis was caused by sys-con randomly losing the USB handle, rendering the USB side of sys-con completely useless.\\n(Hopefully) fixed an issue causing the system to freeze when a controller is disconnected.\\nThe sysmodule will now delete the previous log file if it's too large (about ~130KB) on startup.\\nNote: This is the last release of sys-con that can still be enabled and disabled directly through Kosmos Toolbox without rebooting the console. All later versions will require a reboot.\\n\\n0.5.3\\n\\nFixed the maximum and minimum stick values generated by sys-con.\\nThis caused games like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Resident Evil 4 to crash when that stick value has been reached.\\nWhen using the mode that swaps left stick with d-pad, the stick values generated by d-pad are now clamped to a circle radius.\\nIf you have the latest version of Kosmos Toolbox, you can now manually enable/disable sys-con right from the toolbox menu without having to reboot your console. Hurray.\\n\\n0.5.2\\n\\nNothing much has changed, just updating this for the new Atmosphere 0.10 release.\\n\\nThere is a known issue on all versions of sys-con regarding Xbox One controllers. if you update your Xbox One controller to the latest firmware, it stops working properly. Since you can't downgrade the firmware, I suggest you don't update your Xbox One controllers until a fix has been found.\\n\\n0.5.1\\n\\nFixed multiple controllers being disconnected when disconnecting any controller\\nFixed the sysmodule crashing during sleep mode or eventually stopping recognizing controllers\\nFixed Dualshock 3 getting chaotic inputs when Dualshock 4 is connected\\nAdded an option to change the LED color of Dualshock 4 in config_dualshock4.ini: color_led. Optionally, if you want to turn LED off, set the color values to 0, 0, 0.\\n\\n0.5.0\\n\\nAdded support for Dualshock 4.\\nNOTE: Due to firmware limitations, only one generation of Dualshock 4 can be recognized at a time. If you have a Dualshock 4 model \"CUH-ZCT2E\", you need to go to sdmc:/config/sys-con/config_global.ini and change the value of use_dualshock_2nd_generation to true.\\nBonus feature: You can now customize controller colors! Head over to sdmc:/config/sys-con/ and modify the color values for each type of controller. Most controllers already have customized colors in place.\\n\\n0.4.2\\n\\nFixed some Xbox One controllers being recognized, but not receiving any input. Let me know if this release breaks your controller.\\nFixed original Xbox controllers not having correct input mapping\\n\\n0.4.0\\n\\nThe sysmodule now detects generic XInput devices. I can't promise every single XInput device will work, I can only hope your controller manufacturer follows the XInput protocol to the dot.\\n\\nXbox 360 Wireless Receiver is partially supported! When I say partially, it means that the LED is still blinking and the app doesn't seem to detect controllers disconnect. However, it has full button support and allows to connect up to 4 controllers at once. The config for it is the same as the Xbox 360 Wired.\\n\\n0.3.0\\n\\nThere is now a config folder for the sysmodule! You can find it at sdmc:/config/sys-con/ and modify the stick/trigger deadzones and remap inputs. All the config changes are updated in real time.\\nThe log file has also been moved to the config folder.\\nFixed an issue with some of the Microsoft Xbox controllers not connecting properly.\\nXbox 360 and Dualshock 3 LEDs now no longer blink.\\n\\n0.2.3.1\\n\\nThe 0.2.3 version had improper naming\\n\\n0.2.3\\n\\nHalves the memory used by the sysmodule.\\n[9.0.0+] If you're having freezes or crashes (error 2003-0008) when launching a game, try disabling other memory-intensive sysmodules (sys-ftpd, emuiibo). Or downgrade to 8.0.0.",

The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills.

Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his fellow rabbits from slavery.\\n\\nHistory\\nLugaru was originally developed by David Rosen of Wolfire Games and was open sourced in 2010. It was made cross-platform with the help of Ryan C. Gordon.\\n\\nVarious forks were made at that time, and the most interesting developments were put back together under the OSS Lugaru organization, originally on Google Code and then on Bitbucket.\\n\\nThis new repository on GitLab is run by the same team, and aims at revitalizing the development effort to clean things up, ensuring the code base builds and runs fine on all supported platforms, and easing the packaging of Lugaru in Linux distributions.\\n\\nIdeally, the updated code base could also be used to update the Lugaru HD version sold by Wolfire Games once proven better than the current commercial builds.\\n\\nRun it through hbloader or hbmenu.nsp.

            "author": "XorTroll", 
            "changelog": "0.5\\n\\nemuiibo has been completely rewritten, and this has been incredibly helpful, since almost any issue present for previous versions is no longer a problem ;)\\n\\nKey combos are no longer a thing, since they were a not very friendly way of controlling emuiibo, and having an overlay is 100 times more helpful.\\n\\nThe way emuiibo internally \"mimics\" Nintendo's amiibo services has been improved a lot. This was what caused many games to not work fine (Link's Awakening, Diablo 3, Fire Emblem...). In fact, emuiibo is introducing a new feature which makes amiibo emulation slightly more similar to real amiibos, which made those specific games work (see below).\\n\\nVirtual amiibo connecting/disconnecting: these two are the equivalents of placing a real amiibo in the NFC point/R-stick (connecting it) and removing it from that spot (disconnecting it). Previously, emuiibo \"tried\" to take care of that manually (games like SSBU asked the user to remove the amiibo after saving progress), which resulted in many games freezing when they read amiibos. Now, simply disconnect the amiibo when you need to remove it, and connect it to use it again!\\n\\nSupport for raw bin amiibo dumps works now (it was broken for v0.4)\\n\\nOld (v0.3.x and v0.4) amiibo formats are converted on startup, so no need to create new amiibos, old ones should work :)\\n\\nIPC API changed completely, check the overlay's source as an example of how it works.\\n\\nNow logs are reset on each reboot, so make sure to not reboot or make a copy of emuiibo's log file if wou want to preserve them! (this was done since the log file would get excessively big if it wasn't cleaned)\\n\\nThis is a new addition to the project and, probably, the best and easiest way of controlling emuiibo (thanks to WerWolv for such an amazing project)!\\n\\nThis are its current features:\\n\\nToggle on/off emulation\\n\\nControl virtual amiibo emulation with emuiibo, select a virtual amiibo as active, connect/disconnect it (see above)\\n\\nBrowse through categories, keep your virtual amiibos organized\\n\\nSee in real time if the currently opened game is being intercepted by emuiibo (if you have the overlay open while the game runs, you might be able to spot the exact instant in which emuiibo intercepts the game's amiibo access)\\n\\n\\n\\n0.4\\n\\nemuiibo was updated to latest libnx and libstratosphere, what might fix possible bugs those had before. (libstratosphere's new IPC API is far more accurate now)\\n\\nInternal heap usage was decreased from 0x75000 to 0x5000. (almost 24 times less heap!)\\n\\nSeveral implementation mistakes were corrected, which might have caused issues.\\n\\nThose problems with certain amiibos (mainly BOTW ones) have been fixed, which were caused by a bad handling of amiibo IDs (N sends them in a slightly different way)\\n\\nNow emuiibo has a settings file: settings.json inside emuiibo's directory. The only setting it has for now is whether input combos are enabled, and this defaults to true.\\n\\nIf you want to disable input combos, just edit the file and change the field comboEnabled from true to false, or the opposite to re-enable them.\\n\\nAdded logging, so that most interactions are logged to a logging file (emuiibo.log) in emuiibo's directory, to help with potential issues.\\n\\n0.3.1\\n\\n9.0.0 support\\n\\n0.3\\n\\nEmuiibo has been fully rewritten, what involves several changes:\\n\\nAmiibo moves should be faster now since on previous versions the amiibo dir would be re-scanned (thus iterated over every amiibo) each time user moved to the next amiibo.\\n\\nAmiibo structure and filesystem layout have changed to a WAY more proper one. (see below)\\n\\nNew amiibo structure - dumps no longer required!\\n\\nThe only relevant part of an amiibo is its unique ID (the rest can be emulated), thus having online databases of this IDs, dumps are useless, but still supported ;)\\n\\nAmiibos go now inside /emuiibo/amiibo/ for a better directory layout. Don't worry about backwards compatibility. (see below)\\n\\nAmiibos can be placed inside /emuiibo/amiibo// to be only used in that specific game. Amiibos outside those directories will be used on any game.\\n\\nBackwards compatibility for any kind of amiibo, considering that 3 types exist: single dumps, 0.2.x format and the new 0.3+ format\\n\\nSay hello to a new tool to create virtual amiibos easily - emuGUIibo!\\n\\nMade using Windows Forms, so should be supported by Mono\\n\\nAccesses a full amiibo list from an online API, so the user just has to select an amiibo and customize it!\\n\\nAmiibos are generated on the user-specified directory. If a drive with /emuiibo directory is detected, emuGUIibo will assume it's a console's SD card and default (but not force) that path.\\n\\n(Probably developer only) nfp:emu service changes:\\n\\nCommands were renamed and reordered, so make sure you update your implementation.\\n\\nAdded new command to get emuiibo version by 3 integers (major.minor.micro)\\n\\n0.2.1\\n\\n8.1.0 support, working as always\\n\\nA new command was introduced in nfp:emu (RescanAmiibos)\\n\\n0.2\\n\\nAmiibo progress saving support\\n\\nGames like SSBU allow saving their progress on amiibos. Now this is supported by redirecting savedata to files inside amiibo's \"areas\" directory.\\n\\nThis, in fact, provides another advantage, as real amiibos just allow savedata for one title, while this system allows to have multiple saves.\\n\\nAmiibo system changed\\n\\nFirst of all, don't worry. All amiibo BIN files found in emuiibo dir will be auto-converted to the new system.\\n\\nThe new system has every amiibo in a different directory, which contains the amiibo (\"amiibo.bin\"), a JSON metadata file (\"amiibo.json\"), an \"areas\" directory (see above) and a mii char-info copy (\"mii.dat\").\\n\\nOn this system everything can be customized. In order to change miis you would need the char-info data, which is stored inside the console. To help with this, emuiibo will dump all console miis inside \"miis\" directory in emuiibo dir, named with the index + mii name (example: \"0-XorTroll.dat\"). To use it, copy to the amiibo dir and name it as \"mii.dat\".\\n\\nAn interesting option can be added to the JSON (\"randomizeUuid\" boolean), which makes emuiibo randomize the amiibo UUID. Having this means special circumstances in certain games, like being recognized as a different amiibo each time in BotW, hence infinite supply.\\n\\nIMPORTANT! After using 0.2, since the old system gets changed to the new one, 0.1 won't find any amiibos as they're not on the root dir now. Thus, avoid using 0.1 after using 0.2.\\n\\nHOME button LED blink (7.x+, sadly)\\n\\nOn firmwares on 7.x or higher, performing a combo makes the HOME button blink, which is a simple and nice system to signal that a combo has been performed. Not supported on previous versions for technical limitations.\\nnfp:emu service changed, with new commands\\n\\nAlso, a remainder that the next Goldleaf version (0.6) is going to have emuiibo support, featuring real amiibo dumping to emuiibo-style and more!\\n\\n",

This slows down the GUI a bit but I hope to speed this up for the next release.\\nI also created a discord server for my projects. You can join here: https://discord.gg/ZhRn3nn\\n\\n1.5.3\\n\\nThis version adds in a check for when Emuiibo isn't running (thank you to @Kronos2308 ), Changes the colors of the UI (this was done by me and @Kronos2308 ), and I also improved the updater code so that it no longer assumes Amiigo is in the /switch/ directory which makes updating better for people who downloaded Amiigo through 4tu's HB App Store and CFW packs.\\n\\n1.5.2\\nThis update uses the new 0.4.0 Emuiibo ipc and uses libnx 3.0.0. It should be functionally identical to 1.5.1.\\n\\n1.5.1\\n\\nWith this release when creating new virtual Amiibos using Amiigo Maker the new virtual Amiibo will be created in whatever folder the main UI is currently in.\\nThe main UI's header will now only display the virtual Amiibo's name instead of it's path.\\nEmuiibo is now properly exited when closing the app which previously caused Emuiibo to stop working when Amiigo was opened too many times.\\n\\n\\n\\n1.5.0\\n\\nThis release adds experimental support for categories and other minor changes.\\nTo use categories create a new folder in your Amiibo folder and put virtual Amiibos in it. Press A in Amiigo to enter the sub-folder and B to exit it.\\n\\n1.4.4\\n\\nThis release adds a temporary method to delete Amiibos. This can be done by pressing in on the left stick like a button. My original plan was to add an Amiibo Manager menu which would allow for deleting and renaming Amiibos but I have been busier than I anticipated lately so I haven't had time to implement it properly.\\n\\n1.4.3\\n\\nFixed bug that made the updater always fail\\n\\n1.4.2\\n\\nIn this release I added a check in the updater code to prevent fataling when Github API rate limiting is in effect. I also made changes to Amiigo Maker so if the AmiiboAPI goes down again it will load the offline version instead of crashing.\\n\\n1.4.1\\n\\nAmiibo API is down and if you try to connect to it it will overwrite the offline data with invalid data. This release will crash before that happens. I'll release a better fix soon.\\n\\n1.4.0\\n\\nThis release adds the ability to update Amiigo from within Amiigo and adds a slightly nicer UI (Thank you to shchmue for the border suggestion).\\n\\n1.3.1\\n\\nThis update fixes a crash caused when no Amiibos are available to Emuiibo and Amiigo tries to show their path in the header. Big thank you to Slluxx for both telling me about this bug and theorizing what caused it to happen.",

            "changelog": "v1.8.3\\n\\nImproved the general aes-xts crypto function to match the diskio algorithm (only 2 total aes-ecb calls instead of one per block) and perform the xor operations in 32-bit chunks. Also updated for gcc 10 and merged latest Hekate commits.\\n\\nSysmmc runs get a slight speed improvement, emummc gets a large speed improvement, especially file-based.\\n\\nAlso now supports parsing sept from sept-secondary if FSS0 entry is present in hekate_ipl.ini\\n\\nv1.8.2\\n\\nVersion 10.0.0, in addition to having new key offsets, expands the 80000000000000E1 common ticket save. This revealed a bug in remap init code, now fixed. Also fixed a bug caused by missing ES saves.\\n\\nv1.8.1.\\n\\nFixed BIS key off-by-one index issue for new consoles, fixed titlekey regression\\n\\nv1.8.0\\n\\nLockpick_RCM now supports firmware 9.1.0. Like in update 9.0.0, the root keys didn't change and so consoles on any version from 8.1.0-9.1.0 will dump all current keys.\\n\\nMinerva should be updated on SD to use its performance benefits. If the old library is present, Minerva will not activate.\\n\\nAlso corrected bug where SD seed verification vector was being read from sysnand even when dumping keys from emunand.\\n\\n\\n\\nv1.7.1\\n\\nFixes freezes under certain conditions, now has a Payload menu like Hekate's that allows chainloading to payloads in bootloader/payloads, atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin, or ReiNX.bin\\n\\nv1.7.0\\n\\nLockpick_RCM now parses the ES save files correctly for much quicker Titlekey extraction, ie linear in number of titlekeys rather than checking the whole save container\\n\\nHuge thanks to @Thealexbarney for an excellent source of truth on save parsing in the form of https://github.com/Thealexbarney/LibHac/ and for answering so many questions about it on top of all the hard work reversing FS and constantly improving LibHac\\n\\nAlso corrected a major bug in Hekate's heap code (please do the same if you use Hekate code in your own projects! ref CTCaer/hekate#300 ) and eliminated a few of my own memory leaks, both guaranteed and potential\\n\\nv1.6.4\\n\\nFile write validation is sufficient\\n\\nv1.6.3\\n\\nFixes bad directory check preventing writing keyfiles\\n\\nv1.6.1\\n\\nWhen I added Minerva and titlekey dumping I moved the key save text buffer from a zero-initialized stack array to the heap, and forgot to zero-initialize, followed by many perilous calls to strlen on the buffer which wasn't guaranteed any nulls to terminate! This resulted in a hang while saving keys and/or corrupt key files\\n\\nv1.6.0\\n\\nAdded titlekey dumping! With CTCaer's Minerva it runs in 20-25s depending on sys/emunand, or 40-50s without.\\nAlso added key generation number display to main menu to help guide your sysnand/emunand dumping decision.\\n\\nv1.5.0\\n\\nNow lets users choose whether to dump keys from sysNAND or emuMMC. Also a fix for BIS key generation on consoles released after firmware 5.0.0 (presently it's rare that these have code execution, but eventually this will apply to more).\\n\\nv1.4.0\\n\\nAdded Keys for 9.0.0\\nAlso added BPMP overclock\\n\\nv1.3\\n\\nSupports new keys if run on firmware 8.1.0.\\n\\nv1.2\\n\\nThe main visible differences are that if it's run on a dev console it will correctly name the key file dev.keys and if an upgrade or downgrade fails to install a matching set of package1 and package2, Lockpick_RCM will try every key it can instead of giving up on finding FS keys.\\n\\nv1.1.1\\n\\nFix smmu emulation for tsec on 6.2.0\\n\\nv1.1\\n\\nNow includes support for firmware 8.0.0 along with a big speed increase thanks to advice from CTCaer. Interpolated recent hekate bugfixes as well",
